First, <strong>JavaScript Allong\u00e9 gives you the tools to deal with JavaScript bugs, hitches, edge cases, and other potential pitfalls</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>There are plenty of good directions for how to write JavaScript programs. If you follow them without alteration or deviation, you will be satisfied. Unfortunately, software is a complex thing, full of interactions and side-effects. Two perfectly reasonable pieces of advice when taken separately may conflict with each other when taken together. An approach may seem sound at the outset of a project, but need to be revised when new requirements are discovered.</p>\r\n<p>When you \u201cleave the path\u201d of the directions, you discover their limitations. In order to solve the problems that occur at the edges, in order to adapt and deal with changes, in order to refactor and rewrite as needed, you need to understand the underlying principles of the JavaScript programming language in detail.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\u201cThis book is awesome and blowing my mind in a great way.\u201d <em>Johnathan Mukai</em>\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>You need to understand why the directions work so that you can understand how to modify them to work properly at or beyond their original limitations. That\u2019s where JavaScript Allong\u00e9 comes in.</p>\r\n<p>JavaScript Allong\u00e9 is a book about programming with functions, because JavaScript is a programming language built on flexible and powerful functions. JavaScript Allong\u00e9 begins at the beginning, with values and expressions, and builds from there to discuss types, identity, functions, closures, scopes, and many more subjects up to working with classes and instances. In each case, JavaScript Allong\u00e9 takes care to explain exactly how things work so that when you encounter a problem, you\u2019ll know exactly what is happening and how to fix it.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\u201cEnjoying Javascript Allonge... I think it's the best discussion of functional programming in js I've found so far.\u201d <em>Nicholas Faiz</em>\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Second, <strong>JavaScript Allong\u00e9 provides recipes for using functions to write software that is simpler, cleaner, and less complicated than alternative approaches</strong> that are object-centric or code-centric. JavaScript idioms like function combinators and decorators leverage JavaScript\u2019s power to make code easier to read, modify, debug and refactor, thus avoiding problems before they happen.</p>\r\n<p>JavaScript Allong\u00e9 teaches you how to handle complex code, and it also teaches you how to simplify code without dumbing it down. As a result, JavaScript Allong\u00e9 is a rich read releasing many of JavaScript\u2019s subtleties, much like the Caf\u00e9 Allong\u00e9 beloved by coffee enthusiasts everywhere.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\u201cReading JavaScript Allong\u00e9 by @raganwald.

On one hand you're just grabbing stuff from a data source and shoving it out as JSON, but surviving changes in business logic, database schema updates, new features or deprecated endpoints, etc gets super difficult.</p>\r\n<p>I found most resources out there to be horribly lacking or specifically aimed at one single framework. Many tutorials and books use apples and pears examples which are not concrete enough, or talk like listing /users and /users/1 are the only endpoints you'll ever need. I've spent the last year working at a company called Kapture where my primary function has been to inherit, rebuild, maintain and further develop a fairly large API with many different endpoints exposing a lot of different use-cases.\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>The API in question was v2 when I joined the company and written in FuelPHP, utilizing a now deprecated ORM which had been hacked to death by the original developer. Kapture was in the process of rebuilding it's iPhone application to implement new functionality, so I used this as an opportunity to delete that mess and build v3 in Laravel 4, leveraging it's simple (initially Symfony-based) Routing, Database Migrations, Schema, Seeding, etc. Now we are doing the same for v4 but no rewrite was required this time, even though we have some different functionality the v3 repo was forked to a new one for v4 and both are being actively developed and living side-by-side on the same \"API\" servers.</p>\r\n<p>By passing on some best practices and general good advice you can hit the ground running if you are new to API development. On the flip side, by recounting some horror stories (and how they were overcome/avoided/averted) you can hopefully avoid a lot of the pitfalls I either fell into, or nearly fell into, or saw others fall into. This book will discuss the theory of designing and building APIs in any language or framework with this theory applied in examples built in PHP. I'm going to try and avoid making it code-heavy to stop you falling asleep and to keep the non-PHP developers happy.</p>\r\n<p>Some of the more advanced topics covered here are endpoint testing, embedding data objects in a consistent and scalable manner, paginating responses (including embedded objects) and hypermedia controls (HATEOAS).</p>\r\n<p>Please do not hesitate to get in touch if you have any suggestions or feedback.</p>","id":10807,"meta_description":"Learn how to make APIs that you wont hate with a book written off the back of experience and hard times, available for iBook, Kindle and whatever else.","slug":"build-apis-you-wont-hate","subtitle":"Everyone and their dog wants an API, so you should probably learn how to build them.","title":"Build APIs You Won't Hate","author_string":"Phil Sturgeon","url":"http://leanpub.com/build-apis-you-wont-hate","title_page_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/titlepages.leanpub.com/build-apis-you-wont-hate/original?1415144486","minimum_price":"26.99","suggested_price":"29.99","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/titlepages.leanpub.com/build-apis-you-wont-hate/medium?1415144486","affiliate_url":"http://leanpub.com/build-apis-you-wont-hate?a=27hVMyWVn46xaZCi6E563X","affiliate_earnings_on_default_package":"13.495","num_readers_shown_publicly":1732,"category_slugs":"internet+selfhelp+software"},{"about_the_book":"<p><em>Remember that time you had to build a whole page of HTML links from a .csv file, and you wound up copying and pasting the opening and closing anchor tags 300 times?</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Or when you transferred that list of names into an Excel spreadsheet just to sort it alphabetically?</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Isn\u2019t it a pain to hit Delete three dozen times just because you decided that you want to join the line you\u2019re editing with the line below it?</em></p>\r\n<p>You already have a powerful ally in the fight against tedium: your text editor.

It\u2019s a why-to book designed to clarify the concepts and logic that hold Backbone together.

Building Backbone Plugins fills this gap by showing you what it takes to build scalable applications in Backbone and how to stock your toolbox with exactly what you need.</p>\r\n<h2>Get Real-Life, Real-App Tools &amp; Techniques Distilled from Years of Experience with Backbone.js</h2>\r\n<p>I don\u2019t know about you, but when I first starting using Backbone.js, I fell in love with it almost immediately.</p>\r\n<p>After weeks of tearing my hair out over the hopeless tangle of JavaScript I\u2019d \u201cbuilt\u201d into my latest app, Backbone seemed like the answer to my prayers:</p>\r\n<p>All of the patterns and practices that I\u2019d learned from Windows development and thick GUI applications right there in front of me \u2026 only in JavaScript!</p>\r\n<p>But it wasn\u2019t long before I realized that using Backbone raised problems of its own: for one, a heavy reliance on copy &amp; paste programming. To build out my apps, I had to keep adding more and more boilerplate code \u2014 the stuff that has to be there or nothing works right.</p>\r\n<p>All that copy-and-pasting of code inevitably led to the copy-and-pasting of errors \u2026 which then required copy-and-paste fixes.</p>\r\n<p>And that, frankly, is a ridiculous and wasteful way to code.</p>\r\n<p>Based on my own trial &amp; error-riddled experiences building MarionetteJS for Backbone, Building Backbone Plugins boils down more than 15 years of software development experience into one simple, easy-to-follow handbook designed to meet the real-life needs of actual JavaScript developers and their clients.</p>\r\n<p>Using MarionetteJS as a reference, this book will show you how to write cleaner, more flexible JavaScript as well as how to keep your applications organized and easy-to-maintain \u2014 no matter how complex they get.</p>\r\n<p>\u2013 Derick Bailey, creator of MarionetteJS</p>\r\n<h2>What Others Are Saying (and Loving!)

Do your page scripts, along with any other classes and functions, combine the concerns of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller\" target=\"_blank\">model, view, and controller</a> into the same scope? Is the majority of the logical flow incorporated as include files and global functions rather than class methods? If so, you already know that the wide use of global variables means that making a change in one place leads to unexpected consequences somewhere else. These and other factors make it overly difficult and expensive for you to add features and fix bugs. Working with this legacy application feels like dragging your feet through mud.</p>\r\n<p>But it doesn't have to be that way! This book will show you how to modernize your application by extracting and replacing its legacy artifacts. We will use a step-by-step approach, moving slowly and methodically, to improve your application from the ground up. Moreover, we will keep your application running the whole time. Each completed step in the process will keep your codebase fully operational with higher quality. When we are done, you will be able to breeze through your code like the wind. Your code will be autoloaded, dependency-injected, unit-tested, layer-separated, and front-controlled.</p>\r\n<p>Please note that this book is about modernizing in terms of <em>practice and technique</em>, and not in terms of <em>tools</em>. We are not going to discuss the latest, hottest frameworks or libraries. With the exception of testing systems like PHPUnit, and one or two standalone third-party libraries, the book does not advocate adding third-party code to your existing legacy application.

However, the interface is so full of features that it can be hard to find out how to do things. This book is an answer to that need. It contains fifty different features and uses of Enterprise Architect that you probably don\u2019t know, but that can make life as an Enterprise Architect user simpler and more fruitful. This book contains tips and tricks for getting the maximum out of Sparx Systems Enterprise Architect. From working with elements and connectors to making diagrams to more advanced functionalities like toolboxes, stereotypes and tagged values, the user is guided through the complex user interface of Enterprise Architect. A final chapter offers even more advanced features and some unexpected uses of Enterprise Architect.</p>\r\n<p>This eBook contains over sixty tricks that will make your life as an Enterprise Architect user easier and more successful. Updates of the eBook are free, but the initial price increases as more chapters get added.

This includes running several Rails Applications on a single VPS - great for small side projects.</p>\r\n<p>If you're already running your app on a VPS but the deploy process is flaky - it sometimes doesn't restart or loads the wrong version of the code - this book provides a template for making the process hassle free.</p>\r\n<h2>Section 1: Chef</h2>\r\n<p>How to automate provisioning new servers with chef. By the end you'll be able to get a new server up and ready to use within minutes.</p>\r\n<p>Many standard Rails system configurations are supported out of the box with the example code (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB and Redis). For anything else, detailed instructions for setting up your own custom configurations are provided.\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>The aim of this section is to build a re-usable blueprint you can use whenever you need to setup a new VPS.</p>\r\n<h2>Section 2: Capistrano 3</h2>\r\n<p>Using Capistrano 3 to automate every aspect of deployment, from updating code to managing assets and background workers.</p>\r\n<p>Particular attention is paid to setting up zero downtime deployment - essential if you're iterating rapidly and want to deploy several times per day. This includes a section on common gotchas such as failing to reload the gemfile on deployment as well as a detailed guide to troubleshooting when it goes wrong.</p>\r\n<p>I've spent hundreds of hours combing through blog posts, documentation and tweaking config files. This has got me to the stage where deploying to a VPS is as easy as - in fact often easier than - deploying to Heroku. If you want to do the same, this book will save you a lot of time.</p>\r\n<h2>Current Completion &amp; Feedback</h2>\r\n<p>The first section - provisioning a server with chef - is complete, including instructions for PostgreSQL, MySQL and MongoDB. This includes a \"Five minute VPS\" quickstart section for the impatient.</p>\r\n<p>The second section - deploying with Capistrano 3 - is also available and includes all the information needed to get zero downtime deployments working with Rails 3/4 and Unicorn. As well as detailed sample code, it includes complete instructions for deploying Sidekiq workers, a detailed section on Configuring Zero Downtime deployment and instructions for configuring NGinx Virtualhosts and SSL</p>\r\n<p>Over the next few months I'll be adding additional chapters which go into detail on backups as well as editing the book based on the feedback I've received so far (please keep this coming!).

However, we also need to be <em>cognitively</em> productive: to efficiently use knowledge in order to solve problems, create excellent products and improve ourselves.</p>\r\n<p>There is no shortage of knowledge from which to learn. In fact, we are bombarded with so much information that some claim we are condemned to \"<a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6966823-the-shallows\" target=\"_blank\">The Shallows</a>\" described by Nicolas Carr. That is to be superficial information processors whose brains are (supposedly) being \"rewired\" by the Internet. To be sure, we've all had this experience: We've read a document that had the potential to make us more effective. But weeks later we can hardly remember the content. Worse, years go by and we have yet to apply the gems of knowledge it contains.</p>\r\n<p>This book, however, rejects intellectual defeatism in favour of <em>cognitive productivity.</em> It is designed to help effective people systematically use knowledge and technology to become ever more effective. It does this by leveraging the most progressive attempt humanity has made to understand the human mind: broad cognitive science.</p>\r\n<p><em>Cognitive Productivity</em> is written in three parts:</p>\r\n<p>Part 1 describes the process of taking information (as an input) and becoming more effective (as an output.) Your propensity to meet these requirements is one of the most significant contributors to your personal success. With it, you can optimally benefit from <em>knowledge resources</em> (web pages, ebooks, podcasts, videos, lectures, books, PDF files, etc) Part 1 explains why learning with technology is difficult, even for the best and brightest amongst us. <em>Cognitive Productivity</em> is a pro-active response to those challenges.</p>\r\n<p>Part 2 provides powerful new concepts from cognitive science to help you understand the true engine of your own progress: your mind. It sketches how your mind develops as you master <em>knowledge gems</em>\u2014snips of information with which you build your effectiveness. This surprising model of your mind may forever affect how you view yourself and your learning. You may come to see yourself as a \"mindware developer\" (a developer of your own mind!)</p>\r\n<p>Part 3 contains powerful concepts and practical tips for processing knowledge with software. It will help you evaluate, organize, prioritize and navigate knowledge resources. It will help you analyze and comprehend them. You will learn to identify, extract and master <em>knowledge gems</em>. Part 3 will show you new ways to ensure you apply knowledge gems when they are applicable.</p>\r\n<p>This book conveys a lot of information. (Compare the page count above.) Readers are advised to focus on the parts of the book that matter most to them. Readers who are only concerned with practical information, for example, may choose to read chapter 1, skim chapters 2 and 3, skip Part 2, and delve into Part 3. \u00a0</p>\r\n<p>While<em> Cognitive Productivity</em> is based on existing affective\u00a0cognitive science, it also is an original scientific\u00a0contribution.</p>\r\n<p>With<em> Cognitive Productivity,</em>\u00a0you will learn to learn with today's technology\u00a0while preparing for tomorrow's technology.

But\u2026</p>\r\n<h2>There\u2019s this ONE THING you can\u2019t live without \u2026 And Sublime doesn't have it.</h2>\r\n<p>Why, why, why? Isn\u2019t this just a basic feature? Every editor should do this...</p>\r\n<p>Sublime doesn\u2019t, though. You\u2019ve even scoured the interwebs, looking for a plugin that does what you want, but come up dry.</p>\r\n<p>It wouldn\u2019t be so bad, really, if it wasn\u2019t something you needed <strong>every day</strong>. Often multiple times.</p>\r\n<p>So you grit your teeth, switch to your old editor. Actually you don\u2019t even close it anymore.</p>\r\n<p>Such a hacky workaround. It knocks you out of the zone, breaks your concentration, ruins your mood.</p>\r\n<p>But rather than resigning yourself to a two-editor life ...</p>\r\n<h2>What if you could take charge and add that missing feature yourself?</h2>\r\n<p>If you knew how to tap into Sublime\u2019s rich API and extension mechanisms, you\u2019d look at problems differently.</p>\r\n<ul>\n<li>Instead of wasting time on the same task, day after day, you could write a plugin to automate it away.</li>\r\n<li>Instead of trying to cobble features together and <em>almost</em> getting what you want, you could create a plugin that gets the job done right.</li>\r\n<li>Instead of getting annoyed by repetitive manual tasks, you\u2019d see them as opportunities to create plugins\u2014which you could share with the community so hundreds of thousands around the world could reap the same benefits.</li>\r\n</ul><p>You'd know how to unlock the full power of Sublime Text, and you'd enjoy your experience with Sublime even more deeply.</p>\r\n<h2>\n<em>Writing Sublime Plugins</em> will show you how easy it is to create your own Sublime plugins\u2014even if you\u2019ve never written Python before.</h2>\r\n<p>The book will walk you step by step through creating a real Sublime plugin, explaining key concepts and pointing out common pitfalls along the way.</p>\r\n<p>Some highlights include:</p>\r\n<ul>\n<li>More than 140 pages packed with code and real examples.</li>\r\n<li>30 code snapshots that help you can see how the examples work and test them in your own copy of Sublime.</li>\r\n<li>What Sublime plugins can do\u2014and what they can\u2019t.</li>\r\n<li>How many of the features you think of as baked into Sublime really aren\u2019t, and how this can help you.</li>\r\n<li>Why anyone with basic programming experience can write a plugin\u2014no Python experience required.</li>\r\n<li>9 debugging tricks that will <strong>save you hours of frustration</strong>.</li>\r\n<li>The professional touches that make your plugin stand out from the crowd.</li>\r\n<li>A way to hack the Sublime API to see exactly what is causing an error.</li>\r\n<li>The Rosetta Stone for the Sublime API.</li>\r\n<li>Where to go for more information.</li>\r\n<li>The different types of Sublime plugins, and what each is good for.</li>\r\n</ul><h2>Who is this book for?</h2>\r\n<p>If you've been kicking around an idea for a Sublime Text plugin, but you're not sure how to get started, this book is for you.</p>\r\n<p>On the other hand, if you're already an experienced plugin developer looking for a deep dive on the Sublime APIs, you might not find much new information here.</p>\r\n<p>The book is aimed at programmers with experience in a language like Ruby, JavaScript, PHP or C#.

Above all, this book will help you achieve the promise of agile and iterative delivery: to ensure that the right stuff gets delivered through productive discussions between delivery team members and business stakeholders.</p>\r\n<h3>Who is this book for?</h3>\r\n<p>This is a book for anyone working in an iterative delivery environment, doing planning with user stories. The ideas in this book are useful both to people relatively new to user stories and those who have been working with them for years. People who work in software delivery, regardless of their role, will find plenty of tips for engaging stakeholders better and structuring iterative plans more effectively. Business stakeholders working with software teams will discover how to provide better information to their delivery groups, how to set better priorities and how to outrun the competition by achieving more with less software.</p>\r\n<h3>Who is this book not for?</h3>\r\n<p>This book doesn't cover the basics of stories. We assume that readers know what Card-Conversation-Confirmation means, what INVEST is and how to apply the basic strategies for splitting user stories. This isn't the first book you should read about user stories, if those terms are unfamiliar. There are plenty of good basic books out there, so read them first and then come back. \u00a0Please don't hate us because we skipped the basics, but there is only so much space in the book and other people cover the basics already well enough.</p>\r\n<h3>What's inside?</h3>\r\n<p>Unsurprisingly, the book contains exactly fifty ideas. They are grouped into five major parts:</p>\r\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Creating stories</strong>: This part deals with capturing information about stories before they get accepted into the delivery pipeline. You'll find ideas about what kind of information to note down on story cards and how to quickly spot potential problems.</li>\r\n<li>\n<strong>Planning with stories</strong>: This part contains ideas that will help you manage the big-picture view, set milestones and organise long-term work.</li>\r\n<li>\n<strong>Discussing stories</strong>: User stories are all about effective conversations, and this part contains ideas to improve discussions between delivery teams and business stakeholders. You'll find out how to discover hidden assumptions and how to facilitate effective conversations to ensure shared understanding.</li>\r\n<li>\n<strong>Splitting stories</strong>: The ideas in this part will help you deal with large and difficult stories, offering several strategies for dividing them into smaller chunks that will help you learn fast and deliver value quickly.</li>\r\n<li>\n<strong>Managing iterative delivery</strong>: This part contains ideas that will help you work with user stories in the short and mid term, manage capacity, prioritise and reduce scope to achieve the most with the least software.</li>\r\n</ul><p>Each part contains ideas that we've used with teams over the last five or six years to help them manage user stories better and get more value out of iterative delivery.

The 45-day refund policy means your happiness is 100% guaranteed.\u00a0</p>\r\n<h2>A Comprehensive Compendium</h2>\r\n<p>Scroll down to the bottom of this webpage to find a full table of contents for the current version. \u00a0There is a great deal more in development.<em> Shakespeare: the Evidence</em> grows by 6,000-10,000 words every month</p>\r\n<h2>Find Clarity</h2>\r\n<p><em>Shakespeare: The Evidence</em> is a comprehensive survey of all the evidence relevant to determining whether William Shakspere of Stratford wrote the works attributed to him, with clear arguments from both sides of the Shakespeare Authorship Question, arranged in a simple bullet-pointed format. \u00a0Compiled from the writings of dozens of researchers on both sides of the authorship debate, the author brings order and logic to an enormous and sometimes confusing field by listing hundreds of items of disputed evidence relating to William Shakespeare/Shakspere, detailing arguments and counter-arguments for each one. \u00a0Both Stratfordian and non-Stratfordian arguments are well-represented.</p>\r\n<h2>Locate Primary Sources</h2>\r\n<p>Comprehensive appendices contain the full text of documents, plays and poems that are referenced in the debate. Wherever possible, each section is hyperlinked to primary sources so you can read the original texts in their contexts. \u00a0Contains dozens of images of original documents: manuscripts, title pages, official records. \u00a0Builds into a central repository for everything we know - or think we know - about William Shakspere of Stratford, and the author William Shakespeare - corralling all evidence which can shed light on whether they are one and the same. No cherry-picking here: <em>every</em> piece of evidence forwarded in both the non-Stratfordian and the Stratfordian cause is considered.</p>\r\n<h2>Open Your Mind</h2>\r\n<p>If you've been interested in the Shakespeare authorship question for some time, you'll probably have some fixed ideas about it. But there is always another way of looking at things. \u00a0Don't fall prey to confirmation bias: reading evidence to support your pre-formed beliefs. Instead, open your mind to absorb a range of possibilities. \u00a0If you're a relative newcomer to the Shakspeare authorship question, this book is also ideal. It is not pressing one point of view on its readers, or attempting to persuade you of a single truth. Its easily digestible bullet-pointed format and neutral stance allows readers to quickly absorb the essentials of this complex issue.</p>\r\n<h2>Strengthen Your Arguments</h2>\r\n<p>Whether you are a firm believer that Shakspere wrote Shakespeare, or suspect that he didn't, this book offers you the chance to gain a comprehensive knowledge of the problems at hand and clarify your thinking. It enables you to identify weaknesses in, and logical rebuttals to, the arguments of your opponents, as well as potentially strengthening your own. \u00a0Never again be wrong-footed by relying on an argument that is a logical fallacy, or is poorly supported by the evidence. \u00a0Instead, identify the strongest arguments to support your case and how best to put them.</p>\r\n<h2>Contribute to the debate</h2>\r\n<p>The Shakespeare authorship question is an enormous field, and the only way to compile this book is to pick the brains of many, many people. \u00a0 Readers are encourage to suggest any evidence items not currently included, and contribute arguments and counter arguments, in order to make this book truly comprehensive and truly neutral. Currently many readers are Shakespeare sceptics, and the author would specifically like to ask more Stratfordians to contribute their points of view in order to make it more balanced. Significant contributors to the book will be named on the Acknowledgements page, with the contributor's permission.</p>\r\n<h2>Decide for yourself</h2>\r\n<p>This book will not tell you what to think. It respects all of its readers as intelligent beings that will have different perspectives on the evidence and arguments presented. Some will come at the book with minds made up. \u00a0Others will come in a spirit of curiosity. \u00a0Either way, this is the only book on the Shakespeare authorship question that is determined to let you, the reader, sift through all the evidence - no cherry-picking here - and decide for yourself.</p>\r\n<h2>Not sure?</h2>\r\n<p>If you're not sure the book is for you, have a look at the <a href=\"/shakespeare/read\" target=\"_self\">free sample</a>.

I kept falling into the same cycle: I'd read a wide a array of books, online tutorials, print-outs, go through all their steps, and in the end get almost nowhere. Then I'd quietly go back to my editor of choice until next time I decided to try it out.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>It wasn't until I started abusing the patience of a fellow developer who was a few months ahead of me on the vim learning curve that I came to finally understand how much power vim actually has to offer. He didn't try to tell me that I had to do everything \"the vim way\" or even that I had to give up my favorite editor. Instead he quietly and kindly gave me pointers that I could understand, advice I could appreciate, and encouragement to keep trying. With his help I was surprised how quickly I got comfortable with vim, and how much faster I've been ever since.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>And now I want to pass that kind of learning along. <em>Painless Vim</em> starts with the understanding that you're an intelligent, busy person who has to get actual <em>work</em> done along with learning a new text editor. This book is designed to help you get comfortable with vim <em>incrementally</em>, without demanding that you toss your mouse out the window and disable all the keyboard shortcuts you've learned over the years. The goal is to introduce you to the 20% of vim that you'll use most often first, and give you pointers to the 80% you'll use less often when you're ready to explore.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><em>Painless Vim</em> is also designed to be <em>short</em>, <em>easy to read</em>, and <em>inexpensive</em>, so you can learn quickly and painlessly if vim is for you, without slogging through 500 pages or shelling out a ton of money just to go back to your editor of choice.

They show how to apply Hexagonal Architecture within your application whether you use an open source framework or your own.

And today's software often uses a web interface to use it from any place - via intranet within a company or via internet worldwide. Java is a well established programming language, not only for business critical applications, but for web applications too. This way, it is a good choice to use Java for the web.</p>\r\n<p>JavaServer Faces is a web framework build upon the Java servlet technology which makes it easy to construct a UI from a set of reusable UI components. It provides a simple model for wiring client-generated events to server-side application code. Depending on the developers preference, the client side can be constructed using tags which hides most of that HTML stuff, or it can build up almost with HTML, flavored with some small special markers.</p>\r\n<p>This book introduces you to web development using Java and JSF, which you can use to build complete, small to comprehensive size applications. The goal of this book is to create a good foundation in web development and take the reader to a more sophisticated level. To pursue this goal, related JEE technologies like persistence (JPA), CDI, container based security, test tools and more are discussed.</p>\r\n<p>For a couple of experienced [Java SE] developers, web development still feels a bit unusual. It's not possible to develop an application by just one programming language, controlling everything by just one program (maybe consisting of a bunch of loosely coupled tiers). Browser and application, these are apparently two distinct worlds. The browser just queries some content from a server and displays it at the client and then forgets about the connection. Thus, to continue with the application, the client must include some identifier into the next call to enable the server remembering and restoring the last state. JSF as part of the Java universe is made for this. But you need more. For those readers, who are new to the web, this book offers some additional chapters covering the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and other.</p>\r\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><strong>[Purchase this book soon and get all updates without extra charge.

These, occasionally useful, books won't help you if you're already versant in computer technology but use it in a suboptimal way, wasting your valuable time performing repetitive tasks or struggling with easily avoidable problems. Computing style is what distinguishes a computer expert from a user who just gets by. Although following a few tips won't make you a computing guru, you can readily bridge a large part of the productivity gap between you and an expert by following this book\u2019s advice. The 200+ tips included in the book can provide 80% of an expert\u2019s effectiveness.</p>\r\n<p>The text covers all aspects of computing use: computer-related work habits; web searching and surfing; email handling and etiquette; working with documents, spreadsheets, and presentations; essential advice on typography, data management, security, privacy, and digital preservation; travelling; IT equipment; system administration; ergonomics; entertainment. Most professionals, even seasoned computer users, fail to use computing technology in its full potential. This short book provides specific advice that delivers immediate improvements in effectiveness and job performance.</p>\r\n<p>Through this book's 200+ tips you will learn things like the following.</p>\r\n<ul>\n<li>How can I finish a lengthy report on time?</li>\r\n<li>How can I automate the handling of my email?</li>\r\n<li>Why are email's blind carbon copies an invitation to a disaster?</li>\r\n<li>Which keyboard shortcuts can I use to speed-up my work?</li>\r\n<li>How can I simplify my spreadsheets?</li>\r\n<li>What makes an effective presentation?</li>\r\n<li>How can I ensure I\u2019ll be able to access my files in twenty years?</li>\r\n<li>What should I pack before a trip?</li>\r\n</ul><p><em>The Elements of Computing Style</em> is also available as a printed book at <a href=\"https://www.createspace.com/4970883\" target=\"_self\">CreateSpace</a>.</p>","id":11607,"meta_description":"Nowadays everybody knows how to use a computer.

As new browser technologies are distributed, the arsenal of tools available to web developers grows. HTML5 involves a host of new features available to JavaScript developers. It helps in creating more engaging, performant, and scalable web applications.</p>\r\n<p>Wrinklefree jQuery and HTML5 is a practical, example-driven tutorial that aims to provide a clear pattern for developing JavaScript applications that handle new media and resource-intensive features such as streaming video, webcams and microphones, and accessing filesystems right from the browser.</p>\r\n<p>This book starts with discussing HTML5 features, and then builds a common knowledge of new browser technologies, weaving the practice of using those libraries with the practice of writing jQuery plugins.</p>\r\n<p>I have worked really hard over the past year to make this a great resource for acquiring knowledge of concepts falling under \"HTML5\" and others surrounding jQuery, in a step-wise fashion. Beginners with jQuery should be able to pick up this book and learn a <strong>ton</strong>. Advanced users will find themselves still learning all the trinkets and gizmos available, as there are some very advanced jQuery and HTML5 concepts involved in this book that <strong>many contractors earn USD $150k+ / year for specializing in them</strong>. After you've made it through the book, you'll be comfortable writing your own jQuery plugins and using HTML5 APIs to create unique and memorable user experiences.</p>\r\n<p>All the chapter code is included and provided online, so that readers can follow along, or even use the code for whatever they want. (I believe in providing this code with a \"Do Whatever the Fuck You Want License\").</p>\r\n<p>Grab your own copy today and support creativity, learning, and a better web community :)</p>\r\n<h3>Don't Forget! You will get:</h3>\r\n<p>- An unending source of HTML5 and jQuery information; where chapters and example code will be constantly updated based on reviewer and reader feedback (that means YOU ARE IMPORTANT!)</p>\r\n<p>- A professional contact/resource and a nice online friend -- <a href=\"https://twitter.com/matthiasak\" target=\"_blank\">@matthiasak</a> :)</p>\r\n<p>- Free (AS IN FREE) updates for the book, forever. This means all updates to this book and its code will be yours. I will even email you to let you know the changes and new content.</p>\r\n<p>- My full attention. Because I am a writer representing himself, you get the opportunity to go through me, not a publisher. If you find something difficult to understand or have feedback for this book, hit me up and I will see what I can do to improve the book, its message, and its content.</p>\r\n<h2>This Book is Great for:</h2>\r\n<p>This book is great for developers who are a little familiar with jQuery, and are ready to graduate to writing their own plugins and architecting immersive web applications. It's assumed that you will have some experience with HTML and jQuery already, and be familiar with jQuery selectors, events, and utility functions.

You Losing Sleep Over the Financial Situation in Your Web Agency Business?</h2>\r\n<p>It\u2019s that time of the month again: <em>making payroll.</em> Just like so many months before this one, you have no idea where exactly is your next paycheck coming from. As a website development business owner, you are already doing your best to land new clients, collect payments from past projects and finish due work so that you and your employees could get paid. If only you could carve out enough free time to work on growing your business. If only your creative work did not suffer under the heavy burden of worrying so much. If only you had enough leads coming in. If only your clients paid you on time. If only there was a way to get this business under your complete control. If only.</p>\r\n<h3>Recurring revenue is an elegant solution to many a business trouble.</h3>\r\n<p>To a creative services company, recurring revenue is the holy grail. <strong>Imagine money appearing in your company bank account every month or every year without perpetual worry and constant struggle.</strong> Imagine not having to depend on money coming from new projects. Imagine spending your work days doing your most creative work for awesome, well-paying clients who love everything you do for them. Imagine watching some of your toughest business problems fade away.</p>\r\n<p>If recurring revenue is so awesome, how come so many web agencies don\u2019t have any?</p>\r\n<h3>Recurring revenue is not built automagically, but you can do it and this book will show why, what and how exactly.</h3>\r\n<p><strong>It\u2019s you, the web agency owner, who needs to carefully plan, build, implement, sell and market your recurring revenue services.</strong> Fear and lack of resources, time, energy, experience and know-how is what keeps most web agencies from creating their own recurring revenue streams. Web agency owners aren\u2019t usually aware of which of their problems are easily solved with recurring revenue and because of that lack of awareness, they choose not to act.</p>\r\n<p>Luckily, there's\u00a0<strong>this book - a complete guide to making you aware of the benefits of recurring revenue.</strong> This awareness will help you master the subject and the book's many fresh ideas will infuse you with self-confidence which you need to start the transformation. The book\u2019s many practical examples, resources and tips will help you build and sell your services.</p>\r\n<p>The author of this book, owner of a web agency herself, had to walk her own twelve-year long path toward profitability.\u00a0<strong>This book is the missing manual that the author wishes existed at the time when she co-founded her agency in 2002.</strong> It took her years of trial, error, tears and sweat to realize that recurring revenue was the solution to so many of her agency\u2019s struggles. And after she finally made a decision to focus on building recurring revenue, it took her another twelve months to build all the necessary services and resources to the point where she could start selling them. Six months after that, her agency\u2019s annual recurring revenue increased 35%. Today, her agency\u2019s monthly business expenses are almost fully financed by some form of recurring revenue. The author has distilled her experience into this book so that you could <strong>skip years of indecision and months of work, trial and error.</strong></p>\r\n<h3>YES! is the answer to all your questions below:</h3>\r\n<ul>\n<li>Will you explain\u00a0<strong>what exactly am I losing out on</strong> by not having any recurring revenue in my agency?</li>\r\n<li>Will I read about <strong>the types of services which are good candidates</strong> for recurring revenue?</li>\r\n<li>Will you tell me\u00a0<strong>which recurring revenue streams are bad for my web agency</strong> so that I could avoid them?</li>\r\n<li>Will I learn exactly <strong>how to price</strong> my recurring revenue services?</li>\r\n<li>Will you help me <strong>avoid common pitfalls</strong> which people make when they first try to build their recurring revenue streams?</li>\r\n<li>Will you teach me <strong>how to sell</strong> my services?</li>\r\n<li>Will I find out how to <strong>sell recurring revenue services to my regular customers</strong> and what exactly do I say to them?</li>\r\n<li>Will you help me <strong>write a description</strong> of my services?</li>\r\n<li>Will you show me <strong>specific examples</strong> of what to put in my service contract?</li>\r\n<li>Will you <strong>teach me how to organize my business</strong> around recurring revenue services so that I could build a sustainable web agency?</li>\r\n<li>Will this book <strong>save me tremendous amounts of time, money and energy</strong> and guide me in the right direction?</li>\r\n</ul><p>If the book fails to answer any of your burning questions, the author will be delighted to hear from you. Just contact her and she will answer by writing new book chapters which address your concerns. That\u2019s the beauty of a Leanpub book: you, the reader, get to decide on the contents of the book.</p>\r\n<h3>This book is focused on teaching you how to build services, <em>not</em> products.</h3>\r\n<p>Unlike so many blog posts that you can find online for free, this book will not try to persuade you to abandon your agency business in favor of building products. It won\u2019t tell you to write books or build apps. In fact, the book builds a strong case why you should not start a product business with zero recurring revenue. If you want to stay in the web agency business, this book is for you. If you wanted to build products, you\u2019d become a product company, right? Having said that, the book does nudge you to <strong>productize your services and make them scale better</strong>.</p>\r\n<h3>Will this book solve all your business problems?</h3>\r\n<p>No, it will not. But, as you\u2019ll learn by reading the book, recurring revenue is the second most important of the five pillars on which a profitable web agency builds its foundations. The first pillar is to charge what you\u2019re worth, but this is a topic for another book. Your challenges weren\u2019t created overnight and they will not go away overnight. With recurring revenue, however, everything good that should happen for you, happens faster and with far less struggle. This has been the experience of the author of this book and you are now invited to use her experience to your agency's advantage.</p>","id":15942,"meta_description":null,"slug":"recurring-revenue-web-agencies","subtitle":"Master the Foundation of Highly Profitable Website Development Businesses","title":"Recurring Revenue For Web Agencies","author_string":"Visnja Zeljeznjak","url":"http://leanpub.com/recurring-revenue-web-agencies","title_page_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/titlepages.leanpub.com/recurring-revenue-web-agencies/original?1402342424","minimum_price":"26.0","suggested_price":"44.0","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/titlepages.leanpub.com/recurring-revenue-web-agencies/medium?1402342424","affiliate_url":"http://leanpub.com/recurring-revenue-web-agencies?a=27hVMyWVn46xaZCi6E563X","affiliate_earnings_on_default_package":"13.0","num_readers_shown_publicly":"N/A","category_slugs":"business+internet"},{"about_the_book":"<p>Yii 2 for beginners will take you step by step through setup and installation, and then on to coding in the most \u00a0exciting PHP framework available today. \u00a0The book focuses on creating a reusable template that can serve as the basis for your projects, including the following features:</p>\r\n<ul>\n<li>Setup and install</li>\r\n<li>A Working user model</li>\r\n<li>User registration and login</li>\r\n<li>User Profile</li>\r\n<li>Forgot password recovery</li>\r\n<li>Frontend and backend separation</li>\r\n<li>Helper classes</li>\r\n<li>Access control</li>\r\n<li>Free/Paid content control</li>\r\n<li>RBAC with backend UI</li>\r\n<li>JUI DatePicker</li>\r\n<li>Facebook Social Widgets</li>\r\n<li>Font-Awesome Implementation</li>\r\n</ul><p>This book is perfect for beginning PHP programmers who are ready to move onto framework development. \u00a0The Yii 2 PHP framework is highly scalable and extensible, and loaded with features. \u00a0We introduce you to this wonderful framework and explain in detail everything you need to know to get up and running. \u00a0You will love Yii 2!</p>","id":20726,"meta_description":"Yii 2 for beginners will take you step by step through setup and installation, and then on to coding in the most  exciting PHP framework available today.","slug":"yii2forbeginners","subtitle":"A step by step guide to learning Yii 2 for beginners","title":"Yii 2 For Beginners","author_string":"Bill Keck","url":"http://leanpub.com/yii2forbeginners","title_page_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/titlepages.leanpub.com/yii2forbeginners/original?1415738526","minimum_price":"12.99","suggested_price":"29.99","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/titlepages.leanpub.com/yii2forbeginners/medium?1415738526","affiliate_url":"http://leanpub.com/yii2forbeginners?a=27hVMyWVn46xaZCi6E563X","affiliate_earnings_on_default_package":"6.495","num_readers_shown_publicly":"N/A","category_slugs":""},{"about_the_book":"<p>The aim of the book is to get Go newbies started with developing and deploying web applications written using the Go programming language.

The better we can sense this relationship and the better we are at responding, the easier it is to stay balanced.</p>\r\n<p>Balance Basics shows you how to direct your senses so that you can actually feel our relationship with the earth, in particular the relationship where our center of gravity, our foundation and the earth's center are all in one line.</p>\r\n<p>It also shows you how to respond so that if you feel this relationship going out of alignment, you can respond to bring it back into alignment.</p>\r\n<p>There's nothing mystical about it.

He has been playing video games for years, and he wants to learn programming since he wants to make his own video games someday. This book is intended to be the first step. (No, it doesn\u2019t teach you how to create the kinds of video games a 9 year old can dream up; that takes a lot more knowledge!)</p>\r\n<p>The reason this book exists is to be the best book in the world for a kid who is wanting to learn to program computers to read first. Computer programming is a good skill to have, regardless of what occupation your child eventually does as an adult. (I\u2019d argue it\u2019s much more important than lots of the math than you learn in high school, for example.) But more importantly, learning how to program computers teaches a rigor and discipline of thinking which is useful in any field. This book exists to show kids that they can program computers, and to help them get started.</p>\r\n<p>This book is written like a book for kids in elementary school. My goal is that this book should be accessible for kids between ages 9 and 14. In North America, that\u2019s grades 3-8. My son is working through it as I write it. (I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good book for kids aged 7 and 8: I started writing this book when my son was 7, but he wasn\u2019t ready for it. So, I paused writing it\u2013for 2 years. If your child is 7 or 8, I think that something like Scratch is a better choice for kids of that age.)</p>\r\n<p>No knowledge of programming is assumed. The examples are as short as possible, since I assume the reader can\u2019t type well. (My son can\u2019t touch type, so if I make long examples I\u2019ll hear about it!)</p>\r\n<p>My goal is for this book to be the best programming book for kids to read first. After this book, they can follow what interests them.</p>\r\n<p>This book is written assuming you are using a Mac. I think that a Mac is the best computer for kids to learn to program on. Since this is a beginner book for kids, I can\u2019t write it generically to cover Mac, Windows and Linux. I have to pick one operating system, and have the child follow along verbatim.</p>\r\n<p>Besides teaching programming, the book also teaches basic use of the command line on a Mac. This is accessed via the Terminal program. The reason for this is that I feel that the best way to learn is to follow along, and the simplest way to follow along is to type everything. Real programmers use the command line every day. If you want to learn programming, you should use Terminal and files. Yes, you can play with stuff in a web browser at places like Codecademy, and while this is very friendly and instructive, it is fundamentally a different activity from what real pro- grammers do. And, besides being easier, it\u2019s somehow less rewarding.</p>\r\n<p>If you are letting your child use your Mac computer to follow along, I strongly recommend you sit beside them and follow along! For example, I\u2019m not planning to teach the command to delete files, but it\u2019s fairly short!</p>\r\n<p>The examples are in Ruby. Ruby is a fairly simple programming language. If you\u2019ve ever heard of websites built on \"Ruby on Rails\", you\u2019ve heard of Ruby: it\u2019s the programming language that Rails is written in. This is not a book about how to learn Ruby, however. The examples could have easily been written in JavaScript, CoffeeScript or Python.</p>\r\n<p>==</p>\r\n<p>Translators:</p>\r\n<p>I want this book translated into as many languages as possible! \u00a0I split translation royalties 50/50 with translators, provided that we both donate 30% of our royalties from the translation to Watsi. \u00a0(I am donating 30% of my royalties from this book to Watsi, so that seems appropriate to me. \u00a0100% of donations to Watsi directly fund treatment, so it's money well donated.) \u00a0If you are interested in translating this book, please email me at peter@leanpub.com. \u00a0Basic requirements are that you read English well enough to understand the book and translate it into your native language without too many questions, and that you have access to a Mac computer so you can translate the examples to run on Mac and test that they work. \u00a0My assumption is that you will be capturing your own screenshots, since they will look different for you than they do for me. \u00a0Actually being a software developer is a nice-to-have, since it will help you understand the work and ensure that the explanations make sense in your language, but it's optional.</p>","id":1314,"meta_description":null,"slug":"programmingforkids","subtitle":"","title":"Programming for Kids","author_string":"Peter Armstrong","url":"http://leanpub.com/programmingforkids","title_page_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/titlepages.leanpub.com/programmingforkids/original?1407491820","minimum_price":"9.0","suggested_price":"9.0","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/titlepages.leanpub.com/programmingforkids/medium?1407491820","affiliate_url":"http://leanpub.com/programmingforkids?a=27hVMyWVn46xaZCi6E563X","affiliate_earnings_on_default_package":"4.5","num_readers_shown_publicly":"N/A","category_slugs":"familyandparenting+software+textbooks"},{"about_the_book":"<p>Yoga Basics is designed to make learning yoga poses easier.</p>\r\n<p>Rather than focusing on alignment, it aims to teach you how to feel your body so that you can become a better \"driver\" of your body.</p>\r\n<p>To make yoga poses easier to learn, Yoga Basics breaks them down into easy to learn elements so that even difficult poses become a little bit easier to learn.</p>\r\n<p>Instead of forcing your way into challenging poses like chaturanga dandasana and wheel pose, learn how to feel your way into difficult poses.</p>\r\n<p>Learn to work intelligently.</p>","id":12703,"meta_description":"Wheel pose is one of the more difficult backbending yoga poses.

Curse you Eich! Damn you Crockford!! JavaScript is the worst language ever!\"</h1>\r\n<p>Ever had those moments when reading someone else's JavaScript code and screamed something like the above? Code that appears to do one thing but actually does something else? Welcome to the weird and wonderful world of JavaScript.</p>\r\n<p>JavaScript can be a beautiful language - there exists a book about 100 pages on the good parts of JavaScript after all. However it's more often than not more full of warts. The problem is JavaScript does not follow the principle of least surprise. There are JavaScript code out there that can surprise even the most experienced of JavaScript developers - not in a good way,\u00a0 mind. Accidental globals are just the tip of the iceberg.</p>\r\n<p>If you have ever seen WTF-worthy JavaScript code (and any JavaScript dev worth her salt would have encountered at least one) and wondered wtf is happening, <strong>this book is for you</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>If you were surpised with the result of a particular piece of code, and wondered <strong>why</strong> the results are what they are, <strong>this book is for you</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>If you have ever wondered why <code>[0] == 0</code>? Why <code>\"true\" == true</code> returns <code>false</code> then <strong>this book is for you.</strong></p>\r\n<p>In this book I go through ~12 examples of crazy JavaScript that would make anyone go \"WTF??!\", examples such as:</p>\r\n<ul>\n<li>Why certain Immediately Invoked Function Expressions don't work?</li>\r\n<li>Why in some contexts, commas act funnily.</li>\r\n<li>Why in some cases newlines act funnily.</li>\r\n<li>Why in some cases, Google Chrome appears to support block-level scoping without ES6 syntax</li>\r\n<li>Why truthy values are not true, and why falsey values are not false</li>\r\n<li>Why is <code>eval</code> evil?</li>\r\n<li>What is <code>foo)(</code>\n</li>\r\n<li>And many more</li>\r\n</ul><p>I go through these examples, and then explain how the examples happen and work, in a step-by-step manner. Then in a tongue-in-cheek manner, suggest ways to wreak havoc on the unsuspecting using said \"quirks\" of JavaScript. I for one do not actually condone such behaviour. However, all the examples in this book, I have actually seen in real life, and have often cursed the arsehole developers who wrote them. The actual main aim of this book is to help write better code by showing the obvious pitfalls that you may find when debugging other peoples' codes.</p>\r\n<p>Sometimes, it's not that these developers are intentionally being arseholes. Most times, the code is well-intentioned, but due to the way the language (and/or implementation) works, the results come out unexpectedly. Other times, it is exceedingly intentional, and innocent-looking code can do a lot of (financial) damage. I cover these and more in the book.</p>\r\n<p>If you want to know more about the content, <a href=\"https://speakerdeck.com/chewxy/underhanded-javascript-how-to-be-a-complete-arsehole-with-bad-javascript\" target=\"_blank\">here is a talk I gave about arsehole JavaScript</a></p>\r\n<h2>Who this Book Is For</h2>\r\n<p>This book assumes you are already an intermediate-to-advanced frontend or backend Javascript developer, and is considered to be light reading.

J'y explique comment cr\u00e9er le squelette d'une premi\u00e8re extension, quels fichiers sources sont requis, et quelles structures de donn\u00e9es et d\u00e9clarations sont n\u00e9cessaires.</li>\r\n<li>\n<strong>Environnement de d\u00e9veloppement</strong> : ce chapitre montre comment compiler une version de PHP orient\u00e9e <em>d\u00e9veloppement d'extensions</em> et quelles sont les informations qu'elle nous apporte. J'en ai profit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9senter comment configurer Eclipse CDT pour obtenir un environnement de d\u00e9veloppement avec d\u00e9bugger graphique.</li>\r\n<li>\n<strong>\u00c9crire une fonction</strong> : les fonctions sont au c\u0153ur de PHP et de ses extensions. Nous verrons ici, entre autres, comment recevoir des param\u00e8tres et retourner une valeur. Ce sujet est abord\u00e9 au travers de deux chapitres, le second int\u00e9grant des concepts suppl\u00e9mentaires, comme la r\u00e9ception de zval en param\u00e8tres, les fonctions attendant un nombre d'arguments variable, ou encore le type-hinting.</li>\r\n<li>\n<strong>zval : les variables de PHP</strong> : les variables de PHP sont repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es, en interne, par une structure nomm\u00e9e zval. Ce chapitre nous montrera comment en cr\u00e9er, les lire et les manipuler.</li>\r\n<li>\n<strong>Gestion de la m\u00e9moire</strong> : ce chapitre introduit le <em>Zend Memory Manager</em>, les fonctions d'allocation et de lib\u00e9ration de m\u00e9moire, et pr\u00e9sente comment travailler avec le TSRMLS.</li>\r\n<li>\n<strong>HashTable et tableaux</strong> : la structure HashTable est utilis\u00e9e par PHP pour stocker un ensemble de donn\u00e9es, comme un tableau. Elle est tellement importante pour PHP qu'elle est fr\u00e9quemment utilis\u00e9e en interne, et que de nombreuses fonctions permettent de la manipuler.</li>\r\n<li>\n<strong>Classes et objets</strong>: PHP 5 a apport\u00e9 un v\u00e9ritable mod\u00e8le objet. Ce sujet est couvert \u00e0 travers deux chapitres :\r\n<ul>\n<li>Le premier montre comment cr\u00e9er des classes exposant constantes, propri\u00e9t\u00e9s et m\u00e9thodes, comment travailler avec de l'h\u00e9ritage ou des interfaces et comment stocker des donn\u00e9es complexes.</li>\r\n<li>Le second explique comment travailler avec des espaces de noms et des traits, pr\u00e9sente quelques interfaces commun\u00e9ment manipul\u00e9es et passe en revue les gestionnaires d'objets les plus utilis\u00e9s.</li>\r\n</ul>\n</li>\r\n<li>\n<strong>Erreurs et Exceptions</strong> : PHP propose deux m\u00e9canismes de remont\u00e9e d'<em>impr\u00e9vus</em> \u00e0 l'utilisateur : les erreurs, et les exceptions. Nous verrons ici comment tirer partie de ces deux principes, mais aussi comment transformer des erreurs internes en exceptions.</li>\r\n<li>\n<strong>Configuration par fichier .ini</strong> : le fichier php.ini repr\u00e9sente, pour PHP et pour ses extensions, le standard de configuration permettant aux utilisateurs d'influencer sur leur comportement. Ce chapitre pr\u00e9sentera comment exploiter au mieux cette possibilit\u00e9 de param\u00e8trage.</li>\r\n<li>\n<strong>Tests automatis\u00e9s</strong> : vous n'envisageriez pas de d\u00e9velopper une extension sans tests automatis\u00e9s ? Moi non plus !</li>\r\n<li>\n<strong>Travailler avec des flux</strong> : ce chapitre montre comment utiliser le m\u00e9canisme de flux de PHP, en lecture et en \u00e9criture. Il encha\u00eene ensuite avec la mise en place d'un gestionnaire de flux, avant de passer \u00e0 la notion de contexte de flux et au d\u00e9veloppement d'un filtre de flux.</li>\r\n<li>\n<strong>Les ressources</strong> : nous verrons ici ce qu'est le type <em>ressource</em> et comment d\u00e9clarer et manipuler des ressources, qu'elles soient ou non persistantes.</li>\r\n<li>\n<strong>Quelques points divers</strong> : ce chapitre regroupe quelques points int\u00e9ressants, mais qui ne m\u00e9ritaient pas \u00e0 un chapitre \u00e0 eux seuls, comme la d\u00e9claration de variables super-globales, de constantes, la personnalisation de phpinfo(), ou encore l'ex\u00e9cution de code PHP et l'utilisation de fonctions de rappel depuis une extension.

It's always bugged me how procedural PHP is, in an ecosystem of OOP libraries and frameworks.

Please explain the steps in detail as well\", she continues.</p>\r\n<p>You quake in your boots. You know about truthy and falsey values, but you don't exactly know why a truthy value would return <code>false</code>. Worse, you need to be able to explain how it happened. If only you had brushed up on your knowledge of Javascript quirks. If only there were a book for such reference. You could have aced this interview.</p>\r\n<h2>Know the Whys and Hows</h2>\r\n<p>The good news is you still can. Like any interviews, <strong>you must prepare for your technical interview</strong>, especially so for Javascript, since there are many quirks to Javascript. Do you know them all? Why is <code>eval</code> and <code>with</code> frowned upon? Can you explain how variable hoisting happens, step-by-step? In many technical interviews, it is the \"why\" and \"how\" questions that kill.

It assumes you know your basics (and you should, since you're a rockstar Javascript developer) and merely cover the trickier parts of Javascript.

This is not science fiction, and it's not some kind of promised technology we're hoping to see in the near future. It's already here, ready to download and use. It is already being used commercially to help save energy, predict mechanical breakdowns, and keep computers running on the Internet. It's also at the centre of a vibrant open source community with growing links to leading-edge academic and industrial research. Based on more than a decade of research and development by Jeff Hawkins and his team at Grok, <em>NuPIC</em> is a system built on the principles of the human brain, a theory called <em>Hierarchical Temporal Memory</em> (or HTM).</p>\r\n<p>NuPIC stands for <em>Numenta Platform for Intelligent Computing</em>. On the face of it, it's a piece of software you can download for free, do the setup, and start using right away on your own data, to solve your own problems. This book will give you the information you need to do just that. But, as you'll learn, the software (and its usefulness to you as a product) is only a small part of the story.</p>\r\n<p>NuPIC is, in fact, a working model in software of a developing theory of how the brain works, Hierarchical Temporal Memory. Its design is constrained by what we know of the structure and function of the brain. As with an architect's miniature model, a spreadsheet in the financial realm, or a CAD system in engineering, we can experiment with and adjust the model in order to gain insights into the system we're modelling. And, just as with those tools, we can also do useful work, solve real-world problems, and derive value from using them.</p>\r\n<p>And, as with other modelling tools, we can use NuPIC as a touchstone for a growing discussion of the basic theory of what is going on inside the brain. We can compare it with all the facts and understanding from decades of neuroscience research, a body of knowledge which grows daily. We believe that the theories underlying NuPIC are the best candidates for a true understanding of human intelligence, and that NuPIC is already providing compelling evidence that these theories are valid.</p>\r\n<p>This book begins with an overview of how NuPIC fits in to the worlds of Artificial Intelligence and Neuroscience. We'll then delve a little deeper into the theory of the brain which underlies the project, including the key principles which we believe are both necessary and sufficient for intelligence. In Chapter 3, we'll see how the design of NuPIC corresponds to these principles, and how it works in detail.

Now we all have these multi-core computing beasts on our desks, systems capable of running literally billions of instructions in the time it takes you to blink, but for some reason we\u2019re still treating the command line like a green screen dumb terminal that can only handle one command at a time.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>That\u2019s no way to live.

Tension is what allows us to feel our body in general. While it is pretty easy to learn to feel muscular activity and the tension generated within the belly of a muscle when it is active, connective tissue tension is something we can learn to feel when muscles are relaxed.</p>\r\n<p>If we learn to feel this tension, then we can not only improve body awareness, but also our ability to control our body and respond quickly, even instantaneously. One of the keys to learning to feel this tension is to move slowly and smoothly. But another key is to focus on isolated elements.</p>\r\n<p>After awareness (and control) is developed in isolation it can then be used in integrated \"whole body\" movements or postures.</p>\r\n<p>The exercises start with unweighted exercises since in those it is easier to develop both awareness and control.

At sea we felt fear of fire, rocks, drowning (and being found naked trying to climb into fridge), but it was no comparison to the fear I felt sat in a cubicle in my first office job. This Kafkaesque fear radiated from the people around me. There were rules to be followed, confusion as to why they existed, yet a fear of breaking them. I rarely spoke to my comrades around me, we kept our heads down, built a bubble around ourselves, and dutifully soldiered on.\"</p>\r\n<p>The End</p>\r\n<p>\"I'm done with fear. Letting go, fellowship, openness, courage and reflection replace it, and like fear they slowly spread. We change our life, maybe our teams, perhaps our organisations. This is not a fad, a methodology, a process or tool. This change is a slow, deep, cultural one. At times it seems impossible, armour seems impenetrable, the weight of hierarchy constraining us. This isn't a program, these are networks of real people, relationships, egos, more complex than we can hope to understand. Making work better takes persistence, enquiry, empathy and continual learning.\"</p>\r\n<p>The Rest</p>\r\n<p>This book is about making sense of the senseless; understanding why people behave the way they do at work, and how it's possible to change that by building supportive relationships, rather than competitive ones.

If you're not comfortable with JavaScript, I highly recommend reading both <a href=\"http://oreil.ly/18GKUWk\" target=\"_blank\">JavaScript: The Definitive Guide</a> and <a href=\"http://bit.ly/18GLa7O\" target=\"_blank\">JavaScript Garden</a>. Although I'll quickly go over some necessary fundamentals for beginners, it will be difficult to become a 'node.js developer' without a solid foundation in JavaScript. HTML, CSS, and client-side JavaScript will be necessary for the presentation of your application, while understanding the stateless nature of HTTP will make some of the techniques discussed in this book easier to learn.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Why this book?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Many books on a given technology focus on really digging into a certain framework or a few simple concepts. Node.js is an interesting technology for many reasons, including:\u00a0</p>\r\n<ul>\n<li>it popularized server-side JavaScript</li>\r\n<li>encourages modularization</li>\r\n<li>has a fairly large community</li>\r\n<li>provides amazing throughput for data</li>\r\n</ul><p>I have read many technology books and yet I've always felt like there was a gap between books covering a given technology and how you'd actually undertake creating a full application on your own. When I realized that node.js is attracting a lot of front-end developers and hobbyists to the community, I understood what that missing \"gap\" was: the application life cycle. For developers without a degree in Computer Science or Information Systems, it may be difficult to figure out how to actually start creating a full application. I hope to address this in the text by providing some simple guidelines that help to lay out a clear path between the starting point and the finished product. The intended audience for this book is anyone familiar with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You don't need to be a professional engineer or even have years of experience. In early chapters, I discuss the aspects of JavaScript that I feel are crucial to understanding how to write an application in node.js. \u00a0Where I feel newer developers may benefit from further reading, I suggest online or print resources that I've found helpful.<strong></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>What makes this book different?</strong></p>\r\n<p>When working with Junior developers, I try to avoid the\u00a0<em>sink or swim</em> mentality that many Seniors seem to have. \u00a0Instead, I like to explain why I've chosen one thing over another. In this book, I include an entire chapter to discuss development considerations which are usually omitted from mainstream texts. \u00a0For instance, when was the last time you read a book that suggested a build automation tool? I can't remember any book that clearly explained why a sample application was written to use MongoDB instead of Redis or MySQL. These are things I attempt to cover in this book before\u00a0diving in to the meat of the text you'd find in similar books. I even have a short prototyping chapter for readers who are unfamiliar with the technologies used in the book to try some hands-on code before applying this knowledge to the sample application.</p>\r\n<p>These are all things people with professional full-stack (e.g. client-server-database) experience do on a regular basis. With such a fresh, young community being attracted to node.js application development (many without server-side or database experience) I think this book's early focus on process and maintainability are important aspects for any beginner to pick up.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Technolog<em>ies</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>Writing an application requires a developer to pick up skills in multiple technologies for frameworks.

You can't review somebody else's code if you cannot read it. Bugs are not found by unit-tests, because unit-tests are created to capture errors that <em>we know they exist</em> in the code. Unit-tests only catch bugs that have been re-introduced.</li>\r\n<li>\n<strong>Efficiency:</strong> Maintenance takes about 80% of developers' time. Therefore, spending <em>some</em> time for writing better code will save you up a lot of time when you have to maintain it.</li>\r\n<li>\n<strong>Performance:</strong> Unreadable code is difficult to reason about. Therefore any opportunities for optimisation that may exist are often impossible to notice and fix.</li>\r\n</ul><p>I describe six basic techniques that you can follow in order to eliminate these habits. These techniques can be learned one at a time, improving your coding level progressively. At the end, you will have developed a programming style that</p>\r\n<ul>\n<li>is more readable,</li>\r\n<li>leads to more maintainable code,</li>\r\n<li>promotes reusability, and</li>\r\n<li>often leads to faster code.</li>\r\n</ul><p>All these qualities are not mutually exclusive, you will often achieve all of them at the same time.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>The techniques are easy and therefore</p>\r\n<ul>\n<li>students can apply them</li>\r\n<li>it helps smooth transition from C to C++, without having to change programming paradigm</li>\r\n<li>it allows C++ programmers to write using native idioms, instead of writing like C, Java, or Fortran.</li>\r\n</ul><p></p>\r\n<p><em>C++ for dinosaurs</em> is also available as a printed book at\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.lulu.com/shop/nick-economidis/c-for-dinosaurs-guide-for-readable-maintainable-reusable-and-faster-code/paperback/product-21721942.html\" target=\"_self\">lulu.com</a>.</p>","id":13728,"meta_description":"Learn how to use C++ to produce more readable code, faster than C, and simpler to write.

Facebook, Google, Youtube, Twitter, Skype are some of the services which millions of us use to interact with friends, family, conduct buisnes .</p>\r\n<p>Companies cooperate with intelligence agencies, they are collecting data on the activities on the Internet and over mobile networks thus contributing to a system of mass surveillance. Various corporations and other institutions mainly do it with intention to make money, either by using them to optimize their marketing and sales strategies, or by selling them to other entities who want to use them for the same purposes.</p>\r\n<p>Imagine for a moment that every conversation and every form of communication in the world is accessible to them and how it affects your privacy. These companies collect information about your searches over the internet, who contact's who, manner in witch you communicate as well as content of communication, they know who your friends are, what you like, dislike, what are your political views, religious views, etc.</p>\r\n<p>Privacy is not only the right but also the natural need of every human being. Everyone has the right to free activities on the Internet without anyone\u2019s control over it. Regardless of whether or not you have something to hide, protecting your privacy is a matter of principle, it\u2019s about accessing data without your knowledge and consent for reasons unknown.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>What can we do to protect our privacy?</h2>\r\n<p><strong>First step</strong> is to consider your current level of security and to improve it. Aim of this book is to do precisely that. We will cover steps to achieve and maintain system security. Later on we will go trough encryption methods for securing data on our hard drives as well as cloud storage. Then we will move on to how securely delete data or entire hard drive so that there are no traces of our presence. Next stop will be securing communication by means of encryption for mail, chat and using the web with anonymizing networks.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Second step</strong> and this one is as important as the first one. Spread awareness about the need for the internet as a medium and as a source of information to remain as much as possible free, unattended and neutral. To ultimately preserve it as a free source of information for the future.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Those who would give up Essential Liberty to purchase a little Temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.</p>\r\n<p>- Benjamin Franklin</p>\r\n</blockquote>","id":8844,"meta_description":null,"slug":"Privacy_in_Digital-Era","subtitle":"Everything you do leaves a footprint somewhere.","title":"Privacy in Digital Era","author_string":"Richard White","url":"http://leanpub.com/Privacy_in_Digital-Era","title_page_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/titlepages.leanpub.com/Privacy_in_Digital-Era/original?1402512106","minimum_price":"9.99","suggested_price":"15.0","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/titlepages.leanpub.com/Privacy_in_Digital-Era/medium?1402512106","affiliate_url":"http://leanpub.com/Privacy_in_Digital-Era?a=27hVMyWVn46xaZCi6E563X","affiliate_earnings_on_default_package":"4.995","num_readers_shown_publicly":10,"category_slugs":"internet+software"},{"about_the_book":"<p>The book is provide an overview of the javascript written OS: FirefoxOS front end - gaia.</p>\r\n<p>We'd like to document and findout how mozilla and the community design and achieve this ongoing great goal.

Focused around their priorities without taking yours into account? Project managers all over the world make the same mistakes again and again which in turn leads to unhappy programmers. Check with the list:</p>\r\n<h3>Feeling of burden is stressful</h3>\r\n<p>It's the middle of a Wednesday. You thought it was gonna be such a good week. You started coding your task on Monday, and you still keep working on it. Your boss keeps asking for status update. The customer would also like to know how things are going. It's the third day of working on it. It's finally the time to deliver some code. You need to merge your branch with master often to stay in the loop. And you can't much help your friends working on different parts of the system. A lot of time put into the task, but no visible effects to anyone except you so far. This whole situation feels stressful. Not only for you, but actually for everyone.</p>\r\n<p>Are you tired of working on the same area of code and the same feature for a long time? Days or sometimes even weeks? Feeling disconnected from other team members? That's a sign that something needs to change.</p>\r\n<h3>Lack of self growth is boring</h3>\r\n<p>Have you already mastered one technology on a certain level and now you are more interested in learning new ones? Maybe you are a very good Ruby programmer but only decent JavaScript or frontend developer and would like to improve yourself in that area. The only problem: they keep giving you Ruby tasks because you are already good at it, and not even a simple thing to code on frontend. No chance to expand your horizons except when you are at home. Here you can learn more about Angular, Ember, Node and other trending topics that you know you will have to master sooner or later to stay in the business. But shouldn't we rest at home and spend time with our families? If your current project doesn't give you a chance of becoming a system architect when you want, or opportunity of working and learning about all the technologies used in that project, then there certainly is room for improvement here.</p>\r\n<h3>Uncertainty is killing performance</h3>\r\n<p>When you come back to work after a weekend or holiday, do you immediately know what to work on? Or do you need to contact someone, perhaps even multiple people? Do you know what to do, what to work on when they are not there for you? As developers we are often not so sure about current priorities and we would like to work on tasks that are most important right now and deliver business value to the client. We fear that when we fail to do so we will be blamed. When we are certain that we work on the right thing and the scope of the task is small and well defined we are 100% committed and effective. Confusion in this area costs the project's money and client's happiness. We prefer clarity.</p>\r\n<h3>Wouldn't it be better to work in a project which avoids these pitfalls?</h3>\r\n<p>To work in a project with management process that understands and emphasizes developers needs? If you could actually enjoy the process of making the application, you would love your work way more, wouldn't you? That would be like in the beginning of your journey into the land of programming. Do you still remember that time?</p>\r\n<p>What if you could greatly improve many areas of your current project management that has a direct effect on your and your team's happiness? Like immediately knowing what you should be working on when you start your day? Delivering something valuable even twice a day and being proud of that? Being able to organize your time according to your liking and priorities? Taking your time in the middle of the day to create a meal compatible with your diet, to exercise, walk or take a lovely nap to refresh your mind? What if tasks in an unfamiliar technology are learning opportunities and small challenges instead of being scary monsters? Can you imagine your team collaborating together on the whole code?</p>\r\n<h3>Developers oriented project management to the rescue</h3>\r\n<p>Our ebook is here to help you achieve these goals. It is for people who value Clarity, Focus, Freedom and Collaboration. It contains a list of guidelines that we established at Arkency throughout years of working remotely. You can apply them to your project slowly and every one of them will help you improve some of the aspects. Together they make tremendous difference and let you enjoy a lot of benefits that a programming job can offer. They create a programmer friendly environment in which you can feel comfortable and productive. After all, your team mostly consists of programmers, so the project should be optimized for their efficiency and happiness. But it also creates a nice set of rules that makes the communication between customers, product owners and developers easier.</p>\r\n<p>As programmers we are privileged. In our lives we can enjoy many things that people doing other kinds of job cannot. But we need a work-flow that will let us actually seize the opportunities such as, for example, the possibility to work remotely. Buy the ebook now, push for the right kind of change from bottom up and fix the problems that are making you unhappy.</p>\r\n<h1>Agile doesn't matter when you are not in charge</h1>\r\n<p>Agile provides great opportunity for people to step forward and become leaders. But do you and your company know how to let people enter the path of leadership? How to empower the developers so they can introduce changes that make them more effective? As part of the book we are explaining as weel how developers can play the role of project managers. Your company might not become second Valve or Github but you can certainly benefit from applying changes leading towards more flat organization structure.</p>\r\n<p>By delegating at least some of the classic project manager actives such as meeting with clients, prioritizing tasks and extracting stories to programmers, they are given a chance to understand the business side of the project more deeply and to collaborate directly with the customer. With the technical and business knowledge, programmers can become true leaders for the projects, capable of independently handling issues and delivering the results, without the need for much supervision.</p>\r\n<h2>Notes</h2>\r\n<p>The final price of this ebook will be higher (around $39). Current price is for the beta version of this ebook and for all the future updates.

at project inception.</p>\r\n<p>When we talk to organisations about the benefits of Agile software development, all too often we get the response that the current priority - Big Project X - is too important to fail and that Agile is too risky.\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>In this book we will look at:</p>\r\n<ul>\n<li>the Agile Risk Management Model</li>\r\n<li>the four different kinds of risk faced by

next version (v5) of this book will be published on November 22th, 2014.</strong></p>\r\n<p>It is still a sad reality, that many software development projects are in a very bad condition. The code is of poor quality! That does not necessarily mean that the code is not working correctly. Its external quality, measured by the quality assurance department using blackbox-, user- or acceptance tests, can be very high. It can pass the QA without complaints, and the test report says that they find nothing wrong.</p>\r\n<p>Also users of the software may be very satisfied and happy, and its development has been completed in time and budget (\u2026which is rare, I know). Everything seems to be fine \u2026 really everything?</p>\r\n<h2>The consequences of owning a mess</h2>\r\n<p>Nevertheless, the <strong>internal quality</strong> of this code can be very poor. It can be a big mess. The code is difficult to understand and horrible to maintain and extend. \"Never touch a running system\" is a statement that is frequently heard in such kind of projects. Developers get afraid if they must change anything, or if they need to add new features.</p>\r\n<p>And the cost of owning a mess can be very high. The whole thing ends up in an expensive maintenance nightmare, and it can bring a development organization in serious trouble.</p>\r\n<h2>Take care!</h2>\r\n<p>If developers don't take care about their code, they can produce a large, messy and unmaintainable beast in any programming language. However, it seems to be that particular C++ projects are prone for mess and tend more than others to slip off into a bad state. Lots of C++ code that is written today looks as if it were written in the 1980s.</p>\r\n<p>It seems to be that C++ developers have been forgotten by those who preach the Software Craftsmanship attitude and Clean Code principles. Even the World Wide Web is full of bad, but apparently very fast and highly optimized C++ code examples, with a cruel syntax and completely ignoring elementary principles for good design and well-written code.</p>\r\n<h2>Who this book is for?</h2>\r\n<p>But don't lose heart! Even with C++ code can be written clean.</p>\r\n<p>This book is a must for any C++ developer and software engineer with an interest in producing better code. If you want to teach yourself about writing clean C++, this book is exactly what you need. It is written to help C++ developers of all skill levels and shows by example how to write understandable, flexible, maintainable and efficient C++ code. Even if you are a seasoned C++ developer, there are some nuggets and data points in this book that I think you will find useful in your work.</p>\r\n<p><strong>For more information about the book and additional extras, please visit the official website at: <a href=\"http://www.susodevcpp.com/?utm_source=leanpub&amp;utm_medium=landingpage&amp;utm_campaign=leanpub_link_to_website\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.susodevcpp.com</a></strong></p>","id":6346,"meta_description":"A book about writing maintainable, extensible and durable software with modern C++.","slug":"susodevcpp","subtitle":"","title":"Sustainable Software Development With Clean C++","author_string":"Stephan Roth","url":"http://leanpub.com/susodevcpp","title_page_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/titlepages.leanpub.com/susodevcpp/original?1412543925","minimum_price":"11.9","suggested_price":"15.9","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/titlepages.leanpub.com/susodevcpp/medium?1412543925","affiliate_url":"http://leanpub.com/susodevcpp?a=27hVMyWVn46xaZCi6E563X","affiliate_earnings_on_default_package":"5.95","num_readers_shown_publicly":"N/A","category_slugs":"software"},{"about_the_book":"<p>Questions answered in the book:</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>What can I expect to do as a Wall Street programmer?</p>\r\n<p>How can I find a job as a programmer on Wall Street?</p>\r\n<p>How do I pass a Wall Street interview?</p>\r\n<p>What skills do I need to qualify as a programmer on Wall Street?</p>\r\n<p>What can I expect from my daily routine?</p>\r\n<p>What kind of salary and bonus will I receive?</p>\r\n<p>... and more.</p>","id":12506,"meta_description":null,"slug":"wallstreetprogrammer","subtitle":"","title":"So You Want To Be a Wall Street Programmer?","author_string":"Andrey Butov","url":"http://leanpub.com/wallstreetprogrammer","title_page_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/titlepages.leanpub.com/wallstreetprogrammer/original?1389998758","minimum_price":"15.0","suggested_price":"25.0","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/titlepages.leanpub.com/wallstreetprogrammer/medium?1389998758","affiliate_url":"http://leanpub.com/wallstreetprogrammer?a=27hVMyWVn46xaZCi6E563X","affiliate_earnings_on_default_package":"7.5","num_readers_shown_publicly":"N/A","category_slugs":""},{"about_the_book":"<p>Dit is het 1e Nederlandstalige Agile boek voor het faciliteren van retrospectives.

It is more like a teacher dumping knowledge upon students.</p>\r\n<p>I believe a better way is to engage students in doing carefully selected programming exercises and guiding them solving interesting and useful computer programs. New programming concepts are introduced gradually. \u00a0I put this into practices by teaching my 12-year old daughter Courtney.

If you buy the book, you will receive new chapters for free, until the book is complete.</p>\r\n<p>Chapters</p>\r\n<p>1. <strong>\"The Meeting\"</strong>, in which our heroes and their purpose are presented to the members of the Canadian Society for Heritage, Identity and Tradition.</p>\r\n<p>2. <strong>\"Flight\"</strong>, in which Clark and Duncan argue over the relative authority of the professor and the poet, and Zulecken explains their difference of opinion.</p>\r\n<p>3. <strong>\"The Treeplanter's Tale, Part One\"</strong>, in which Clark encounters his first real Canadian, and hears half of a coming of age story in a working language to which he is not accustomed.</p>\r\n<h2>Excerpt from Chapter One: The Meeting</h2>\r\n<p>'But all of our efforts at sustaining our culture in this way, as earnest as they have been, have unfortunately failed - yes, I say failed - to provide us with a single, defining source to consult when we are led, by those forces foreign and domestic that would divide us, to question what that unique cultural identity really is. The genius behind this frightening insight into such a fundamental oversight' - here Zulecken again paused for another sip of water, allowing the audience to relish his rhetorical flourish - 'is the recognition that we who have been labouring to define this unifying identity have been doing so _without any authoritative, established, definitive and explicit center of our own_. Yes, I can see from the looks on your faces that the scales have begun to fall from your eyes, as they did from mine, when I was first privileged with this clear and ingenious insight.\u00a0</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>'How can we have been so blind, I wondered. Between all of the classes, all of the books and magazines, between all of the films and documentaries, between all of the funding and grants and conferences and studies and plays and acts and poems and novels and awards shows, and, uh, researches and journalisms and stories and textbooks and biographies and monographs and indeed commercials, that have been produced to promote this great cultural project, there is no single, definitive, authoritative source for our people to consult when the question of Canadian identity arises.' This time it was a slow shaking of heads and an exchange of worried looks that acknowledged the crowd's agreement. 'There is no _Encyclop\u00e9die_, no great novel, no single work of any kind that we can consult for an answer to this great question. And of course there is no constitution to which we can refer, at least not in the American sense - and there never will be, as long as our loyal, independent heritage is conserved in the, uh, unwritten traditions preserved, ah, unwritten in the minds of our best, that is, I mean to say, ah, minds and leaders.' Sip.\u00a0</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>'But fortunately for us, there is a man, the very man who first brought this great Canadian mistake, I mean, uh, gap, to my attention, who is willing, both willing and able to - to fill this gap, as it were, or rather, to, ah, stopper this great cultural hole.' At this point Zulecken, somewhat flustered by the turn his speech had taken, turned to his left, to direct the attention of the audience to the evening's as yet silent speaker, who was still sitting with a dignified air at the table where Zulecken had left him. 'I am speaking, of course, of a man familiar to all of us who are involved in the great Canadian national cultural crusade: Professor Gordon Donald Clark.'</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Politely enthusiastic applause broke out as the audience turned its gaze upon their hero, the esteemed scholar and cultural personality, the aforenamed Clark.\u00a0</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>To the casual observer, he appeared, naturally enough, to be just another friendly white-collar Canadian approaching the later stages of middle age, with his medium height, his greying and gradually disappearing hair, the somehow comforting paunch protruding from beneath his my-wife-bought-it-for-me sweater, his slightly weathered khakis, and his cheap dark brown leather boating shoes.\u00a0</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>But to the informed observer, it was his eyes that held the promise that there was, indeed, a remarkable personality beneath such evident mediocrity. For those eyes, which appeared at first glance in the guise of an inconspicuous washed-out blue, and which seemed to express, with their slightly retreated focus and dim glint, nothing more than that sense of earnest distance which betrays the universal Canadian desire to be liked - such eyes could only be taken by those who knew of the man's national achievements to be, by virtue of their evident banality, deeply deceptive.\u00a0</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>For where, the observer had to ask, was there any indication in their humble appearance, that from behind those eyes stared the brain of a man who, in his youth, had won the silver medal upon graduating from the University of Toronto's famous Albert College, and who as a student had had the rare honour of having been tutored jointly by those great eminences of intellectual fame, Marshall McLuhan and Northrop Frye? Should there not be some sign of a redoubtable, dominating personality in the gaze of a man who had since the age of 28 been a tenured professor at that very same college, who had for decades been a leading figure in his chosen academic specialty, Canadian Literature, and whose renown was unmatched amongst CanLit professors across the country? Why was there no mark in his sensitive brow of his deep connection to the land, which he had expressed in his many groundbreaking articles on the subject of nature and landscape in the Canadian novel? For what reason was there no indication in his bearing or his countenance that this was a man who had won the Governor General's Award for Non-Fiction, not once, or twice, but _three_ times, and who had even met _the Queen_ once at Rideau Hall in Ottawa?\u00a0</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Surely, faced with the fact of such weak eyes on such a celebrated man, the observer had to conclude that the answer to this paradox must lie in his own internal failure of judgment, in his own personal incapacity to recognize the signs of true greatness; and it must be the limitations of his own intelligence which cause him to see only cheerful mediocrity where so many awards, and indeed induction into nothing less than the nation's pantheon, that elevated institution nominated with grand quixocitism the Order of Canada, proved without question that there must be much more dwelling somewhere within the acclaimed man than his apparent ordinariness, and his habitually sweet confusion, would indicate.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>In response to the applause, Clark slowly inclined his head, as though to suggest that he did not deserve such recognition, but at the same time to acknowledge that he politely accepted the fact that the audience genuinely believed he did.\u00a0</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Suddenly, however, he redirected his gaze, with something approaching a stern look, towards Zulecken, who had joined in the applause, but had unfortunately kept his hands too close to the microphone as he had done so. As a result, the heavy moderator's own enthusiastic clapping was reverberating painfully and awkwardly around the room. Zulecken, though, mistakenly took Clark's attention as a sign that he should continue clapping, and so only redoubled his efforts. Indeed, he began to drown out the applause of the audience, and many stopped clapping in order to put their hands to better use - that is, to protect their abused ears. Finally, Clark was driven to raise and lower his outstretched right hand, glaring angrily as he sent the unfortunate signal to a confused Zulecken, who only redoubled his adulatory efforts before he finally stopped clapping on his own account, and turned to face the audience, which stared at him in stunned silence.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>'Professor Clark's many accomplishments in the field of Canadian Literature require no recounting before the members of our Society,' Zulecken continued, 'but it is of course conventional to list some of any speaker's accomplishments nonetheless, and it is my great pleasure to be in a position to carry out this traditional duty. There are, of course, too many achievements to recount in the brief time we have available tonight, and so, sadly, I will cite only those works most relevant to the matter at hand, in order to limit the length of this introduction.' Some applause.\u00a0</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>'Professor Clark first came to prominence as a contributor to our nation's cultural self-awareness with his stunning first book, _The Median is the Message: Canada's International Literary Reputation_, which bravely investigated the cunning manner in which Canadian authors have spread their unnoticed influence all over the world, eschewing the blunt instrument of writing so-called \"great\" works, and thus by writing \"mediocre\" works carrying out a sophisticated critique of that, uh, outdated colonial fiction of hierarchical superiority in the evaluation of literature, so selfishly abused by our self-promoting southern neighbours in the establishment of their competitive form of literary fame and the correspondingly vulgar form of their unfortunately vast influence.'\u00a0</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Particularly pleased with that one, Zulecken rewarded himself with another sip of water, as he let the impact of his words sink in to his evidently stunned audience.\u00a0</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>'And, as though he intended with sublimity to stun our nation out of its unreflective apathy, by confronting Canadians with too much to consider at once, this first work of the young Professor Clark, which sent shockwaves throughout the emerging institution of Canadian Studies, was followed a mere eight years later by the equally brilliant and groundbreaking _From Me to Thee to We: The Role of National Unity in Literary Representations of Canadian Identity_, a remarkable work which established in a new critical language the connection between Canada's unique brand of cultural nationalism, which combines keeping us together into both an end and a means, and the literary representation of its people.' A sip from Zulecken, and squinting contemplation from everyone else.\u00a0</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>'But as great as these two seminal works were, it was Professor Clark's next contribution to the Canadian literary community that was destined to utterly change our understanding of the crucial role played by nature and the landscape in Canadian literature. I'm speaking, of course, of the even more seminal _Peace, Order and Good Wonderment: The Use of Awe in the Representation of Landscape in Canadian Literature_, which has been a standard reference work in Canadian Literature courses since its publication.\u00a0</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>'And most recently, of course, there is his Governor General's Award-winning masterpiece, _Now You GG, Now You Don't: The Ups and Downs of Fame in Canadian Literary Biography_, which charts with exceptional circumspection the commanding position that is held by our national awards system as it guides the establishment of literary reputation in the self-perception of our nation.' Sip.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>'Half of any one of these works,' continued Zulecken, 'would have been enough to earn tenure and establish a significant presence on the CanLit stage. But taken together, and even excluding his many articles and conference papers, they have established Professor Clark as the leading authority on our nation's literature. That great accomplishment, however, has not been enough for this industrious figure, and it leads me to the subject that has brought us together on this historic occasion.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>'For Professor Clark, after many years of contemplation, has come to the radical and, if I may, revolutionary conclusion that the study of fiction cannot offer a complete account of Canadian identity.\u00a0</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>'He has seen that what is missing in this analysis is an account, a comprehensive account, of real Canadian lives, real Canadian stories - and especially of the way everyday, ordinary Canadians conduct and, crucially, describe themselves. And it is for this reason that he has conceived his latest project, the grand cultural project for the better understanding of our national identity, and, indeed, for the betterment of our nation, which he is here tonight to announce to the public formally and for the first time.'</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Here Zulecken paused, taking another sip of water and allowing the importance of the grand undertaking to sink in to the sympathetic audience, which had at once grown silent and restless - a sure sign, Zulecken was convinced, that his words had achieved their intended stunning effect.\u00a0</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>'And so, without further ado, I would like to make way for a description of this great endeavour by the great man who will himself undertake it, and who just happens to be the Lieutenant-Governor of our distinguished Society - Professor Gordon Donald Clark!'</p>","id":3881,"meta_description":"","slug":"theidentityproject_theatlantichalf","subtitle":"The Atlantic Half","title":"The Identity Project","author_string":"Len Epp","url":"http://leanpub.com/theidentityproject_theatlantichalf","title_page_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/titlepages.leanpub.com/theidentityproject_theatlantichalf/original?1392764584","minimum_price":"9.99","suggested_price":"11.99","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/titlepages.leanpub.com/theidentityproject_theatlantichalf/medium?1392764584","affiliate_url":"http://leanpub.com/theidentityproject_theatlantichalf?a=27hVMyWVn46xaZCi6E563X","affiliate_earnings_on_default_package":"4.995","num_readers_shown_publicly":"N/A","category_slugs":"fiction"},{"about_the_book":"<p>You've decided you want to go work at Acme Inc, so you need to get yourself prepared for life in the corporate jungle. \u00a0This book will introduce you to some of the animals you will meet there and describe in colourful details what life is really like as you explore the new reality you are faced with.</p>\r\n<p>Or perhaps you are stuck in a corporate jungle and just want a different way to think about your daily life. \u00a0Once you picture Peter, your boss, as a snake, you might naturally change how you behave around him, because we have instinctive reactions to animals but mistakenly assume we can apply logic when dealing with humans.</p>\r\n<p>There is no reason you have to be content surviving in the corporate jungle. \u00a0Through some of the illustrations and scenarios in the book, you may identify opportunities in your own corporation where you can thrive. \u00a0There is no right way to thrive, there is only your way to thrive. \u00a0One person may thrive by deliberately being difficult and obtuse, confident they are doing their best for the corporate, another may be deliberately disrupting and challenging the status quo. \u00a0Imagining your own reactions and interactions in animal terms may be just the tonic you need, or may help you identify opportunities where you are surviving due to your animal behaviours and becoming a different animal would allow you to thrive. \u00a0</p>\r\n<p>Regardless of your reason for reading this book, it will hopefully bring something different to the daily grind of corporate life. \u00a0Happy Hunting :)</p>","id":12446,"meta_description":"","slug":"thrive","subtitle":"Surviving in a Corporate Jungle","title":"Thrive","author_string":"Mark Barnes","url":"http://leanpub.com/thrive","title_page_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/titlepages.leanpub.com/thrive/original?1406306106","minimum_price":"4.99","suggested_price":"9.99","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/titlepages.leanpub.com/thrive/medium?1406306106","affiliate_url":"http://leanpub.com/thrive?a=27hVMyWVn46xaZCi6E563X","affiliate_earnings_on_default_package":"2.495","num_readers_shown_publicly":"N/A","category_slugs":"humorandsatire"},{"about_the_book":"","id":21184,"meta_description":null,"slug":"adiantiframeworkdesenvolvendoe-commerce","subtitle":"Desenvolvendo E-commerce com PWD Lib e Adianti Framework","title":"Adianti Framework Desenvolvendo E-Commerce","author_string":"Alexandre E.

After a period of instability, drought, famine and disease, most of the world was damaged beyond hope of repair. It was in these conditions that the former EU decided to open its mainly un-touched land to refugees. At first many refugees fled to Europe, but as their numbers grew, so did the strain on the European economy. It was in these conditions that governments rose and fell. In the year 2075, the last immigrants to the EU arrived before a force field, decades in research, fell over Europe enveloping it in its protective glow. The rest of the world would now have to fend for themselves.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>In the year 2080, the once peaceful land of Europe has been torn asunder. With the arrival of the foreigners, more problems had arisen than anticipated. The Eastern Nations believed that there was no room for the foreigners and after years of persecution, took a stance to eradicate them from their soil. The Western Allied Forces did not agree with this, and for the first time in almost a century, Europe was at war once more. Torn between two sides, Europe fell into a period of chaos. With all of the Western\u2019s forces engaging the East\u2019s, the task of protecting the civilians from internal dangers fell to trainees and recruits, militiamen and farmers alike.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Early in 2085, Alpha Squadron, the West\u2019s most advanced and capable academy force was all but eliminated as they responded to a rebel attack. They were replaced by new members from all walks of life, most not having the respect of other trainees and officers. But none would know the true potential locked deep within these recruits, none except their commander. Trapped in twisted plots and counterplots, Alpha Squadron may be the best hope that the West has for survival, if they can survive their service at the academy uncorrupted.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><strong>Previous Release Notes:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Release notes V0.95.50</strong></p>\r\n<p>Point form V0.95.50: * In the e-mail sent I accidently entered 0.92.50, which was the previous versions hotfix.

It is a clever, insightful book that makes you completely rethink your 'impossible' situations.\"</p>\r\n<p>Now let's let reader Dennis Cadena describe the book:</p>\r\n<p>Etiquette bans wearing white after Labor Day. On Precursor, the planetary setting of Gerald Weinberg's immensely entertaining novel Mistress of Molecules, such a stricture is superfluous given the impracticality of white clothing in its dismal, pollution-filled environment. Which is not to imply that Precursor eschews rules; on the contrary, it is a society replete with onerous ecclesial canons enforced by an exclusively male ministerial arm against citizenry enslaved through addiction to crocus\u2014a drug that is both vital to human survival in Precursor's hostile atmosphere and monopolistically controlled by a cartel of church, state and corporations.</p>\r\n<p>The novel's opening scene dramatically portrays this oppressiveness in its depiction of a kangaroo court overseen by a pope who has preordained the sentence and execution of Nicholas Valois whose only real crime was being a threat to Precursor's ruling hegemony by his discovery of the means to manufacture crocus.</p>\r\n<p>A science fiction novel with humans settled on different planets controlled by religious zealots may at first seem incongruous, but humans did not invent the advanced technology that enabled their galactic Diaspora. Instead, it was given them by the alien Zgaarid to use allowing the story to posit a future that is an extrapolation of the 17th and 18th century colonization of the United States and thereby to create an imaginative, yet never improbable, setting for the two principal characters - Libra and Andre.</p>\r\n<p>Libra, who lives on Precursor, is Nicolas' posthumous daughter and a skilled chemist in her own right. Andre was born on Gemariah where, although he suffered a Dickensian childhood of moralistic abuse at his father's hand, he manages to become literate via the powers of his native curiosity and intelligence.</p>\r\n<p>Structurally, the novel intertwines Libra's and Andre's stories leading to their fated meeting. Libra vows to carry on her father's legacy and free Precursor from its oppression by an elaborate plan of terrorism to bring down the ruling class. Andre resolves to liberate himself from the ungodly pedophiles and tyrants who inhabit the seminary to which his father exiles him as punishment for the sin of learning to read.</p>\r\n<p>For both, their wits and their confidence are the keys to their salvation, but it is not a perfectly smooth road either ends up travelling. As their stories unfold, the pair has much to learn about unintended consequences and much to unlearn about their own unexamined and na\u00efve assumptions.</p>\r\n<p>While such a tale may appear thematically to be overly somber, Weinberg works with a gentler touch as he deftly weaves comedic scenes throughout. Some involve imaginative and unexpected minor characters, key to enlivening the plot and providing many delights to readers; but most are in the form of the small and big moments when Libra and Andre come to realize the limits of their own intelligence and the possibility that, as Hamlet reminds Horatio, there is more than is dreamt of in their philosophies.</p>\r\n<p>The moment of change, the teaching moment, is the major surprise that Weinberg's novel holds for its readers. No one should miss the opportunity to partake in such an enjoyable and enlightening journey - something only the most magical storytellers conjure in their writings.</p>","id":14720,"meta_description":null,"slug":"mistressofmolecules","subtitle":null,"title":"Mistress of Molecules","author_string":"Gerald Weinberg","url":"http://leanpub.com/mistressofmolecules","title_page_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/titlepages.leanpub.com/mistressofmolecules/original?1398460986","minimum_price":"6.99","suggested_price":"6.99","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/titlepages.leanpub.com/mistressofmolecules/medium?1398460986","affiliate_url":"http://leanpub.com/mistressofmolecules?a=27hVMyWVn46xaZCi6E563X","affiliate_earnings_on_default_package":"3.495","num_readers_shown_publicly":0,"category_slugs":"fiction+science_fiction+thriller"},{"about_the_book":"<p><strong><em>\u201cA gripping read, I enjoyed it very much.\u201d</em> Jill Paton Walsh, Booker Prize shortlisted author of <em>Knowledge of Angels.</em></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>How much loyalty does a mother owe to her son?

CIPA\u2019s power was attached to federal library grants. Those libraries that implemented child porn filters got free money and technology discounts or got left out. CIPA supposedly allows adults to request for library Internet filters to be disabled, but I\u2019m quite sure I could not succeed in any such request at my library.</p>\r\n<p>In my state, Georgia, a separate state law requires public schools and public libraries to adopt and enforce reasonable policies of \u201cInternet safety\u201d that will protect children from access to \u201charmful\u201d material. The law prohibits a public school or library from receiving state funds unless it implements and enforces an acceptable-use policy.</p>\r\n<p>Since CIPA intends to \u201cprotect children\u201d from \u201charmful\u201d websites, not only did librarians want to get more funding, but they got caught in the glamor of protecting innocent children. In the meanwhile, the FCC has been <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/guides/childrens-internet-protection-act\" target=\"_self\">creating guidelines</a> to help condition students to what acceptable content is. Where children spend most of their days, school and the library, are subject to mandatory filtering and monitoring. As our kids grow, they\u2019ll already have the expectation that they\u2019re being watched and filtered by government entities.</p>\r\n<p>My own county library\u2019s <a href=\"http://forsythpl.org/aboutFCPL/showPolicy.aspx#policy_anchor_18\" target=\"_self\">Internet acceptable use and safety policy</a> has a warning about the futility of CIPA mandated Internet filters, warning parents to monitor computer use \u201cclosely.\u201d</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>In accordance with the Children\u2019s Internet Protection Act (CIPA), all library computers are equipped with software that is designed to block access to sites that contain visual depictions and/or information which may reasonably be construed as being obscene, child pornography, or materials \u201charmful to minors\u201d as currently defined by law. Despite these provisions, patrons may still encounter sites they find personally offensive. For this reason, patrons must assume responsibility for their own use of the Internet. Parents who are concerned about the contents of the Internet are strongly advised to closely supervise their children\u2019s use of this service and assist them in selecting sites that are consistent with personal and family values and appropriate for the age and understanding of their children.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Strangely, with all I know about the Internet and technology, have basically no fear that my kids will find inappropriate content on the Internet until they\u2019re much older. Before you label me in as a bad parent, I \u201cprotect\u201d my kids Internet at home with filtered DNS requests through <a href=\"http://www.opendns.com/\" target=\"_self\">OpenDNS</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The defining difference with my use of OpenDNS is that I chose a provider of filtering, judged my own level of trust in their service and accuracy, select what I do and do not want filtered, and can turn it off when I feel like it. I didn\u2019t implement my household filter as part of a government mandate.</p>\r\n<p>It\u2019s the \u201clawful content\u201d part I keep coming back to, though. When I visited my county library earlier this year, I opened <a href=\"http://calibre-ebook.com/\" target=\"_self\">Calibre</a>, an e-book manager, and was notified of an available update. Upon attempting to load the Calibre site, I was notified that I was attempting to view inappropriate content. I had to petition to the IT staff to get a whitelist exception added to the library proxy. It was a perfect example of how to protect against \u201charmful\u201d content, the filters have to err on the side of more aggressive content restrictions.</p>\r\n<p>Government intrusions don\u2019t ever get smaller. Federal and state agencies have already decided what is lawful content on the Internet and have coerced or mandated the filtering of it. Where will the next bit intrusion creep up? <em>Who will be deciding what is lawful?</em> In <a href=\"https://deekayen.net/exploiting-noninterventionalists\" target=\"_self\">a blog article</a>, I experimented with loading alternate operating systems on library computers and bypassing Internet filters. Most people don\u2019t have such a skillset, or even a knowledge about what options are available to them under CIPA (like requesting to disable the library filters), so their filtered access to the Internet will continue - it will be the norm. That\u2019s not really OK.</p>\r\n<h2>Not trusting anonymity networks</h2>\r\n<p>Millions of people use anonymity services. TorrentFreak <a href=\"http://torrentfreak.com/which-vpn-services-take-your-anonymity-seriously-2014-edition-140315/\" target=\"_self\">keeps a list of the VPN providers</a> that they think take anonymity seriously.</p>\r\n<p>In 2011, at the height of fame for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LulzSec\" target=\"_self\">Lulzsec</a>, I was a user of the VPN provider <a href=\"https://www.hidemyass.com/\" target=\"_self\">HideMyAss!</a>. Then it <a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/09/26/hidemyass_lulzsec_controversy/\" target=\"_self\">became public that HideMyAss! started keeping logs</a> in order to comply with a court order to identify a member of Lulzsec. Certainly, one way to handle the court order was to comply as they did.</p>\r\n<p>I stopped using HideMyAss! and switched to <a href=\"http://www.acevpn.com/\" target=\"_self\">AceVPN</a> after actually reading their privacy policy in great detail. Only later did I discover, through a momentary mis-configuration of one of their VPN servers, that they use a <a href=\"http://www.squid-cache.org/\" target=\"_self\">Squid caching proxy</a> to optimize web delivery. While using Squid isn\u2019t \u201clogging\u201d traffic, it\u2019s certainly at least keeping breadcrumbs of what sites were browsed through that VPN server. It\u2019s the VPN server equivalent of keeping track of all the library books you\u2019ve checked out.</p>\r\n<p>I stopped using AceVPN shortly after that and started using one of TorrentFreak\u2019s recommendations, <a href=\"https://proxy.sh/panel/aff.php?aff=115\" target=\"_self\">proxy.sh</a>. They claim they don\u2019t log anything, that payments are disassociated from VPN login credentials, and have a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_canary\" target=\"_self\">warrant canary</a> message. Their headquarters is also in the obscure <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seychelles\" target=\"_self\">Republic of Seychelles</a>.</p>\r\n<p>In spite of all the efforts a company like proxy.sh, they\u2019re still a public service. That means government agencies can sign up for the service just like any other average person and discover all the VPN service locations, service ports, and protocols. That gives agencies like the NSA all they need to know to target datacenters and backbone providers through beam splitter rooms like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_641A\" target=\"_self\">Room 641A</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The NSA doesn\u2019t need to get court orders for a company like proxy.sh, because their mandate is to track the communications of non-US people. A provider like proxy.sh leases virtual private server space from providers all over the world and the governments in those locations could just as easily issue a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security_letter\" target=\"_self\">National Security Letter</a> to a regional datacenter without even involving proxy.sh and triggering their warrant canary, or even more extreme, causing a <a href=\"https://www.wordnik.com/words/hara-kiri\" target=\"_self\">hara-kari</a> like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/08/lavabit-email-shut-down-edward-snowden\" target=\"_self\">Lavabit</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The problem is that the NSA\u2019s mandate forces them to treat users of any anonymity VPN provider (or <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/\" target=\"_self\">Tor</a>) as a suspicious person. Therefore, by using an anonymity VPN company, you may bypass logging by your ISP or tracking by Google, but you\u2019re assuredly using an Internet endpoint that is being monitored by spy agencies. Moreover, that those spy agencies are paying extra attention to your VPN endpoint just because you felt the need to use a VPN.</p>\r\n<p>Even if you layer Tor through an anonymous VPN provider, the use of <a href=\"http://www.thoughtcrime.org/software/sslstrip/\" target=\"_self\">sslstrip</a> on exit nodes is a known vulnerability. The authority operators even keep a list of <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/badRelays\" target=\"_self\">badExit nodes</a> that are known to do SSL man-in-the-middle attacks or strip SSL. Just one, non-government guy in the world needs to think it would be funny to setup a Tor exit node, log all your stripped SSL, and post it to the Internet for your VPN-wrapped Tor connection to be rendered pointless. Things like this have happened more than once, and even <a href=\"http://invisibler.com/tor-compromised/\" target=\"_self\">lasted for months</a>.</p>\r\n<h2>What\u2019s a private person to do?</h2>\r\n<p>I think you have to assume that any organized, anonymous VPN provider has all of their VPN servers get extra-special attention from spy agencies. That includes any provider listed by TorrentFreak, Tor, <a href=\"https://geti2p.net\" target=\"_self\">I2P</a>, <a href=\"http://yacy.net/\" target=\"_self\">YaCy</a>, anonymous web proxies, etc.</p>\r\n<p>When making a plan for your anonymity, confidentiality, privacy, or even circumvention of filters, you have to consider your priorities and what your ultimate goals are. Using a service, like proxy.sh, may bypass Internet filtering, but exchanges the access for additional endpoint monitoring by government agencies.</p>\r\n<p>In this guide, I propose a configuration to use your own VPN server which may not necessarily be targeted for extra scrutiny by spy agencies, can bypass Internet censorship like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Firewall_of_China\" target=\"_self\">Great Firewall of China</a>, doesn\u2019t use un-trusted or even hostile endpoints like with Tor. It can bypass most deep packet inspection technologies unless your available Internet connection ports are restricted to ones which your private VPN server doesn\u2019t have setup.</p>\r\n<p>This guide uses ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS), the most likely ports to be available on even the most restricting Internet connections. By using your own, private VPN server and obfuscating your VPN server\u2019s traffic with tools from Tor, I think you get the best mix of breaking through censorship, privacy, and logging by your ISP.</p>\r\n<p>This guide will discuss the use of <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/pluggable-transports/obfsproxy.git/blob/HEAD:/doc/obfs3/obfs3-protocol-spec.txt\" target=\"_self\">obfs3 (The Threebfuscator)</a> and <a href=\"https://kryptera.se/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ScrambleSuit-A-Polymorphic-Network-Protocol-to-Circumvent-Censorship.pdf\" target=\"_self\">ScrambleSuit</a>. They protocol obfuscation layers for TCP protocols. When combined with OpenVPN hosting VPN service on TCP ports 80 and 443, not only will your Internet traffic be un-readable, but deep packet inspection won\u2019t even be able to tell what you\u2019re doing on the Internet. The best your ISP will be able to assume is that your connections over port 80 or 443 are encrypted websites. If they attempt to connect to your OpenVPN server with a web browser, it won\u2019t respond because it\u2019s not a web server!</p>\r\n<p>Create your own virtual private network using a <a href=\"https://www.linode.com/?r=1784f2516a909b1cd5d1e90d2dcfa43b176e4f8e\" target=\"_self\">Linode</a>, Debian, OpenVPN, and obfsproxy.</p>\r\n<p>This book is best-suited for technology savvy people who are already familiar with some aspects of Linux server management and tools like OpenSSH in a terminal.

Each sentences or phrase has 8 characters and so I've divided it into blocks of eight phrases (each with 64 characters.)</p>\r\n<p>My own goal has been to learn the cursive script for 64 characters each day.\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>Then I'll work on seal script.</p>\r\n<p>Anyway, 64 characters in a sitting is doable, plus I've tried to lay it out in such a way that it is easy to look up individual phrases as well as individual characters.</p>\r\n<p>The current edition lists the characters in order, plus has a rhyming index, where I've organized characters according to the endings of their pronounciation.</p>\r\n<p>I think this can make pronounciation practice easier.</p>\r\n<p>But try it out for yourself to see.</p>\r\n<p>As I write this it also occurse to me that I should include a lookup index. I will probably include a Cangjie lookup index, a radical lookup index, a pinyin lookup index, and maybe even an english lookup up index.</p>\r\n<p>Also to come, a \"whole phrase\" definition. Currently it only contains single character definitions.</p>\r\n<p>As my calligraphy gets better, future editions may include a sample of my Cao shu or cursive style calligraphy.</p>","id":13241,"meta_description":null,"slug":"the1000characteressay","subtitle":"A Reference Including: Pronunciation, English Definition and Rhyming Index To Make Learning the 1000  Character Essay Easier","title":"The 1000 Character Essay","author_string":"Neil Keleher","url":"http://leanpub.com/the1000characteressay","title_page_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/titlepages.leanpub.com/the1000characteressay/original?1393582811","minimum_price":"8.0","suggested_price":"10.0","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/titlepages.leanpub.com/the1000characteressay/medium?1393582811","affiliate_url":"http://leanpub.com/the1000characteressay?a=27hVMyWVn46xaZCi6E563X","affiliate_earnings_on_default_package":"4.0","num_readers_shown_publicly":0,"category_slugs":""},{"about_the_book":"<p>M\u00e1s all\u00e1 de los intereses de la salud, la econom\u00eda, la \u00e9tica y a\u00fan el karma, el vegetarianismo posee una dimensi\u00f3n espiritual m\u00e1s elevada que puede ayudarnos a desarrollar nuestro amor natural por Dios.</p>\r\n<p>Este libro es algo m\u00e1s que una compilaci\u00f3n de recetas lacto vegetarianas: es una muestra de las ventajas que le ofrece el vegetarianismo y el arte de cocinar ofreciendo los alimentos, mejorando su salud con comidas m\u00e1s placenteras y nutritivas.</p>\r\n<p>Y para los que sienten curiosidad espiritual este libro es tambi\u00e9n una introducci\u00f3n a la conciencia de Krishna, la filosof\u00eda mas antigua del mundo.
